Kind: captions Language: en So we talked three years ago. I'm curious in your view, what has been the biggest update of the last three years? What has been the biggest difference between what it felt like last three years versus now? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say actually the underlying technology like the exponential of the technology has has gone broadly speaking I would say about about as I expected it to go. I mean there's like plus or minus you know a couple there's plus or minus a year or two here. There's plus or minus a year or two there. I don't know that I would have predicted the specific direction of code. Um but but actually when I look at the exponential it it is roughly what I expected in terms of the march of the models from like you know smart high school student to smart college student to like you know beginning to do PhD and professional stuff and in the case of code reaching beyond that. So you know the frontier is a little bit uneven. It's roughly what I expected. I will tell you though what the most surprising thing has been. The most surprising thing has been the lack of public recognition of how close we are to the end of the exponential. To me, it is absolutely wild that, you know, you have people, you know, within the bubble and outside the bubble, you know, but but you have people talking about these these, you know, just the same tired old hot button political issues and like, you know, around us. We're like near the end of the exponential. I I want to understand what that exponential looks like right now because the first question I asked you when we recorded three years ago was, you know, what's up with scaling? How why does it work? Um I have a similar question now but I feel like it's a more complicated question because at least from the public's point of view. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Three years ago there were these you know well-known public trends where across many orders of magnitude of compute you could see how the loss improves and now we have RL scaling and there's no publicly known scaling law for it. It's not even clear what exactly the story is of is this supposed to be teaching the model skills is supposed to be teaching metalarning. Um what is the scaling hypothesis at this point? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so I have actually the same hypothesis that I had even all the way back in 2017. So, in 2017, I think I talked about it last time, but I wrote a doc called the the big blob of compute hypothesis. And and and you know, it it wasn't about the scaling of language models in particular. When I when I wrote it, GPT1 had had just come out, right? So, that was you know, one among many things, right? There was back in those days there was robotics. People tried to work on reasoning as a separate thing from language models. there was scaling of the kind of RL that happened that you know kind of happened in Alph Go and uh you know that that happened at Dota at OpenAI and um you know people remember Starcraft at Deep Mind you know the Alpha Star um so uh it was written as a more general document and and the specific thing I said was the following that and you know it's it's very you know Rich Sutton put out the bitter lesson a couple years later um uh but you know the the hypothesis is is basically the same so so what it says is all the cleverness, all the techniques, all all the kind of we need a new method to to do something like that doesn't matter very much. There are only a few things that matter and I think I listed seven of them. One is like how much raw compute you have. The other is the quantity of data that you have. Then the third is kind of the quality and distribution of data, right? It needs to be a broad broad distribution of data. The fourth is I think how long you train for. Um the fifth is you need an objective function that can scale to the moon. So the pre-training objective function is one such objective function right another objective function is you know the the kind of RL objective function that says like you have a goal you're going to go out and reach the goal within that of course there's objective rewards like you know like you see in math and coding and there's more subjective rewards like you see in RL from human feedback are kind of higher order higher order versions of that and and then the sixth and seventh were things around kind of like normaliz ation or conditioning like you know just getting the numerical stability so that kind of the big blob of compute flows in this laminer way instead of instead of running into problems. So that was the hypothesis and it's a hypothesis I still hold. I I don't think I've seen very much that is not in line with that hypothesis. And so the pre-trained scaling laws were one example of what of of of kind of what we see there. And indeed those have continued going like you know uh you know I think I think now it's been it's been widely reported like you know we feel good about pre-training like pre-training is continuing to give us gains. What has changed is that now we're also seeing the same thing for RL right so we're seeing a pre-training phase and then we're seeing like an RL phase on top of that. Um and with RL it's it's actually just the same like you know even even other companies have have published um uh um like um you know in some of their in some of their releases have published things that say look you know we train the model on math contests you know aime or or the kind of other things and you know how well how well the model does is log linear and how long we've trained it and we see that as well and it's not just math contest it's a wide variety of RL tasks. And so we're seeing the same scaling in RL that we saw for pre-training. Um you mentioned Richard Sutton and the bitter lesson. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I interviewed him last year and he is actually very non LLM pill. And if I'm if I I don't know if this is his perspective, but one way to paraphrase this objection is something like look something which possesses the true core of human learning would not require all these billions of dollars of data and compute and these bespoke environments to learn how to use Excel or how does an you know how to how to use PowerPoint, how to navigate a web browser. And the fact that we have to build in these skills using these RL environments hints that we're actually lacking this core human learning algorithm. Uh and so we're scaling the wrong thing. And so yeah, that does raise a question. Why are we doing all this RL scaling if we do think there's something that's going to be humanlike in its ability to learn on the fly? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I think I think this kind of puts together several things that should be kind of thought of thought of differently. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think there is a genuine puzzle here, but it it may not matter. Um, in fact, I would guess it probably it probably doesn't matter. So, let's take the RL out of it for a second because I actually think RL and it's a red herring to say that RL is any different from pre-training in this matter. Um, so if we if we look at pre-training scaling, um, it it was very interesting back in, you know, 2017 when Alec Radford was doing GPT1. If you look at the models before GPT1, they were trained on these data sets that didn't represent a wide, you know, distribution of text, right? You had like, you know, these very standard, you know, kind of language modeling benchmarks and GBT1 itself was trained on a bunch of, I think it was fanfiction actually. Um, but you know, it was it was like literary, you know, it's like literary text, which is a very small fraction of the text that you get. And what we found with that, you know, and in those days it was like a billion words or something. So small data sets and represented a pretty narrow distribution, right? Like a narrow distribution of kind of what what you can see what you can see in the world. And it didn't generalize well. If you did better on um you know the the you know I forget what but some some kind of fanfiction corpus um it wouldn't generalize that well to kind of the other hat. you know, we had all these measures of like, you know, how well does how well does a model do at predicting all of these other kinds of texts. You really didn't see the generalization. It was only when you trained over all the tasks on the you, you know, the internet when you when you kind of did a general internet scrape, right, from something like, you know, common crawl or scraping links on Reddit, which is what we did for GPT2. It's only when you do that that you kind of started to get generalization. Um, and I think we're seeing the same thing on RL that we're starting with first very simple RL tasks like training on math competitions. Then we're kind of moving to, you know, kind of broader broader training that involves things like code as a task. And now we're moving to do kind of many many other tasks. And then I think we're going to increasingly get generalization. So that that kind of takes out the RL versus the pre-training side of it. But I think there is a puzzle here either way which is that on pre-training when we train the model on pre-training you know we we use like trillions of tokens right and and humans don't see trillions of words so there is an actual sample efficiency difference here there is actually something different that's that's happening here which is that the models start from scratch and you know they have to get much more much more training but we also see that once they're trained if we give them a long context length. The only thing blocking a long context length is like inference. But if we give them like a context length of a million, they're very good at learning and adapting within that context length. And and so I don't know the full answer to this, but but I think there's something going on that pre-training it's it's not like the process of humans learning. It's somewhere between the process of humans learning and the process of human evolution. It's like it's somewhere between like we get many of our priors from evolution. Our brain isn't just a blank slate, right? Whole books have been written about. I think the language models, they're much more blank slates. They literally start as like random weights. Whereas the human brain starts with all these regions. It's connected to all these inputs and outputs. Um and and so maybe we should think of pre-training and for that matter RL as well as as being something that exists in the middle space between human evolution and you know kind of human on on the spot learning and as the in context learning that the models do as as something between long-term human learning and short-term human learning. So, you know, there there's this hierarchy of like there's evolution, there's long-term learning, there's short-term learning, and there's just human reaction. And the LOM phases exist along this spectrum, but not necessarily exactly at the same points that there's no analog to some of the human modes of learning. The LOMs are kind of falling between the points. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Um, yes. Although some things are still a bit confusing. For example, if the analogy is that this is like evolution, so it's fine that it's not that sample efficient, then like well, if we're going to get the kind of super sample efficient agent from in context learning, why are we bothering to build in, you know, there's RL environment companies which are it seems like what they're doing is they're teaching it how to use this API, how to use Slack, how to use whatever. It's confusing to me why there's so much emphasis on that if the kind of agent that can just learn on the fly is emerging or is going to soon emerge or has already emerged. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I I I mean I can't speak for the emphasis of anyone else. I can I can only talk about how we how we think about it. I think the way we think about it is the goal is not to teach the model every possible skill within RL just as we don't do that within pre-training. Right? Within pre-training we're not trying to expose the model to you know every every possible uh you know way that words could be put together. Right? you know, we're it's it's rather that the model trains on a lot of things and then and then it reaches generalization across pre-training, right? That was that was the transition from GPT1 to GPT2 that I saw up close which is like you know the the model reaches a point you know I I I I like had these moments where I was like oh yeah you just give the model like you just give the model a list of numbers that's like you know um you know this is the cost of the house this is the square feet of the house and the model completes the pattern and does linear regression like not great but it does it but it's never seen that exact thing before and and so to you know to to the extent that we are building these RL environments the the goal is is very similar to what is be you know to what was done five or 10 years ago with pre-training with we're trying to get a we're trying to get a whole bunch of data not because we want to cover a specific document or a specific skill but because we want to generalize. I mean I I think the framework you're laying down obviously makes sense like we're making progress towards AGI. I think the crux is something like nobody at this point disagrees that we're going to achieve AGI in this century. And the crux is you say we're hitting the end of the exponential um and somebody else looks at this and says, "Oh yeah, we we're making progress. We've been making progress since 2012 and then 2035 we'll have a humanlike agent." And so I want to understand what it is that you're seeing which makes you think um yeah obviously we're seeing the kinds of things that evolution did or that human within the human lifetime learning is like in these models and why think that it's one year away and not 10 years away. &gt;&gt; I I I actually think of it as like two there's kind of two cases to be made here or like two two claims you could make. One of which is like stronger and the other of which is weaker. So, I think starting starting with the weaker claim, you know, when when I first saw the scaling back in like, you know, 2019, um, you know, I wasn't sure. You know, this was the whole this was kind of a 50/50 thing, right? I thought I saw something that was, you know, and and my claim was this is much more likely than anyone thinks it is. Like, this is wild. No one else would even consider this. Maybe there's a 50% chance this happens. um on the basic hypothesis of you know as you put it within 10 years we'll get to you know you know what I call kind of country of geniuses in a data center I'm at like 90% on that um and it's hard to go much higher than 90% cuz the world is so unpredictable um maybe the irreducible uncertainty would be if we were at 95% where you get to things like I don't know may maybe multi you know multiple companies have you know kind of internal turmoil and nothing happens and then Taiwan gets invaded and like all the all the fabs get blown up by missiles and and you know and then now you scenario you know just you could construct a scenario where there's like a 5% chance that it it or you know you can construct a 5% world where like things things get delayed for for for for for 10 years that's maybe 5%. There's another 5% which is that I'm very confident on tasks that can be verified. So I think I think with coding I'm just except for that irreducible uncertainty there's just there's I mean I think we'll be there in one or two years there's no way we will not be there there in 10 years in terms of being able to do it end to end coding. My one little bit the one little bit of of fundamental uncertainty even on long time scales is this thing about tasks that aren't verifiable like planning a mission to Mars like uh you know doing some fundamental scientific discovery like like crisper like you know writing a writing a novel hard to hard to verify those tasks. I am almost certain that we have a reliable path to get there. But like if there was a little bit uncertainty, it's there. So, so, so, so, so on the 10 years, I'm like, you know, 90% which is about as certain as you can be. Like I think it's I think it's crazy to say that this won't happen by by by 2035. Like in some sane world, it would be outside the mainstream. But but the emphasis on verification hints to me as a lack of a lack of uh belief that these models are generalized. If you think about humans, &gt;&gt; we are good at things that both which we get verifiable reward and things which we don't. You're like you have no no this is this is why I'm almost sure we already see substantial generalization from things that that verify to things that don't ver. We're already seeing that. But but it seems like you were emphasizing this as a spectrum which will uh split apart which domains we see more progress and I'm like but that's it doesn't seem like how humans get there. &gt;&gt; The world in which we don't make it or or or the world in which we don't get there is the world in which we do we do all the things that are that are verifiable and then they like you know many of them generalize but but we kind of don't get fully there. We don't we don't we don't fully you know we don't fully color in this side of the box. It's it's it's not a it's not a binary thing. But but it also seems to me even if even if in the world where generalization is weak when you only say baref domains it's not clear to me in such a world you could automate software engineering because software like in some sense you are quote unquote a software engineer but part of being a software engineer for you involves writing these like long memos about your grand vision about different things and so I don't think that's part of the job of sui that's part that's part of the job of the company but I do think involves like design documents and other things like that um which by the way the models are not bad they're already pretty good at writing comments and start and so with with again I'm making like much weaker claims here than I believe to like you know to to to to kind of set up a you know to to distinguish between two things like we're we're already almost there for software engineering and we are already almost there by by what metric there's one metric which is like how many lines of code are written by AI and if you use if you consider other productivity improvements in the course of the history of software engineering compilers write all the lines of software and but we there's a difference between how many lines are written and how big the productivity improvement Oh yeah. And um and then like we're almost there, meaning like the how big is the productivity improvement, not just how many lines are written. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So so I actually um I actually I actually agree with you on this. So I I've made this series of predictions on um code and software engineering and and and I think people have repeatedly kind of misunderstood them. So So let me let me let me let me let me lay out the spectrum, right? Like I think it was like you know like you know eight eight or nine months ago or something I said you know the AI model will be writing 90 90% of the lines of code in like you know 3 to 6 months which which happened at least at some places right happened happened at entropic happened with many people downstream using our models but but that's actually a very weak criterion right people thought I was saying like we won't need 90% of the software engineers those things are worlds apart right like I would put the spectrum term as 90% of code is written by the model, 100% of code is written by the model and that's a big difference in productivity. Um 90% of the end toend SWE tasks, right? Including things like compiling, including things like setting up clusters and environments, testing features, writing memos, 90% of the SU tasks are written by the models. 100% of today's suite tasks are are are written by the models. And and even when when when that happen doesn't mean software engineers are out of a job like there's like new higher level things they can do where they can they can manage and then there's a further down the spectrum like you know there's 90% less demand for SWES which I think will happen but like this is this this is a spectrum and you know I wrote about it in in the adolescence of technology where I went through this kind of spectrum with farming um uh uh and so I I actually totally agree with you on that. It's just these are very different benchmarks from each other but we're proceeding through them super fast. It seems like in part of your vision it's like going from 90 to 100 um first it's going to happen fast and two that somehow that leads to huge productivity improvements. Um whereas when I noticed even in green field projects that people start with cloud code or something people report starting a lot of projects and I'm like do we see in the world out there a renaissance of software all these new features that wouldn't exist otherwise and at least so far it doesn't seem like we see that and so that does make me wonder even if even if like I never had to intervene on cloud code um there is this thing of like there's just the world is complicated jobs are complicated and closing the loop on self-contained systems whether just writing software or something how much sort of how much broader gains we would see just from that. And so maybe that makes us this should dilute our estimation of the country of geniuses. &gt;&gt; I well well I actually I I like I like simultaneously I simultaneously agree with you agree that it's a reason why these things don't happen instantly but at the same time I think the the the effect is going to be very fast. So like I don't know you could have these two poles right one is like um you know AI is like you know it's not going to make progress it's slow like it's going to take you know kind of forever to diffuse within the economy right economic diffusion has become one of these buzzwords that's like a a reason why we're not going to make AI progress or why AI progress doesn't matter and and you know the other axis is like we'll get recursive self-improvement you know the whole thing you know can't you just draw an exponential line on the on the curve you know it's it's we're going to have you know Dyson spheres around the sun in like you know you know so many nanconds after you know after after we get recursive I mean I'm completely caricaturing the view here but like you know there there there are these two extremes but what we've seen from from the beginning you know at least if you look within anthropic there's this bizarre 10x per year growth in revenue that we've seen right so you know in 2023 it was like 0 to 100 million 2024 it was 100 million to a billion. 2025 it was a billion to like 9 or 10 billion. And then &gt;&gt; you guys should have just bought like a billion dollars with your own product so you could just like have a clean 10V [laughter] and and the first month of this year like that that exponential is you would think it would slow down but it would like you know we added another few billion to like you know to to to we added another few billion to revenue in January and and so you know obviously that curve can't go on forever right you know the GDP is only so large I don't you know I I would even guess that it bends that it bends bends somewhat this here. But like that is like a fast curve, right? That's like a that's like a really fast curve. And I would bet it stays pretty fast even as the scale goes to the entire economy. So like I I think we should be thinking about this middle world where things are like extremely fast but not instant where they take time because of economic diffusion because of the need to close the loop because you know it's like this fiddly oh man I have to do change management within my enterprise you know I have to like you know uh uh you know I I I I like I set this up but but you know I have to change the security permissions on this in order to make it actually work or you know, I had this like old piece of software that, you know, that like, you know, checks the model before it's compiled and and and like released and I have to rewrite it. And yes, the model can do that, but I have to tell the model to do that and it has to it has to take time to do that. and and and so I think everything we've seen so far is is compatible with the idea that there's one fast exponential that's the the capability of the model and then there's another fast exponential that's downstream of that which is the diffusion of the model into the economy not instant not slow much faster than any previous technology but it has its limits and and and and this is what we you know when I when I look inside anthropic when I look at our customers fast adoption but not infinitely fast. &gt;&gt; Um can I try a hot take on you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I feel like diffusion is cope that people use to say when it's like if the model isn't able to do something they're like oh but the diffus it's like a diffusion issue. But then you should use the comparison to humans. You would think that the inherent advantages that AIs have would make diffusion a much easier problem for new AIs getting onboarded than new humans getting onboarded. So an AI can read your entire Slack and your drive in minutes. They can share all the knowledge that the other copy other copies of the same instance have. You don't have this adverse selection problem when you're hiring AI because you can just hire copies of a vetted AI model. Um hiring a human is like so much more hassle. And people hire humans all the time, right? We pay humans upwards of $50 trillion in wages because they're useful. Uh even though it's like in principle it would be much easier to integrate AI into the economy than it is to hire humans. I think like the diffusion I feel like doesn't really I I think diffusion is very real and and and and and doesn't have to you know doesn't exclusively have to do with limitation limitation limitations on the AI models like again there are people who use diffusion to to you know as kind of a buzzword to say this isn't a big deal. I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about, you know, AI will diffuse at the speed that previous I think AI will diffuse much faster than previous technologies have, but but not infinitely fast. So, I'll I'll just give an example of this, right? Like there's like claude code. Like claude code is extremely easy to set up. Um, you know, if you're a developer, you can kind of just start using cla code. There is no reason why a developer at a large enterprise should not be adopting claude code as quickly as you know individual developer developer at a startup and we do everything we can to promote it right we sell uh we sell cla code to enterprises and big enterprises like you know big big financial companies big pharmaceutical companies all of them they're adopting claude code much faster than enterprises typically adopt new technology, right? But but again, it like it it it it takes time like any given feature or any given product like claude code or like co-work will get adopted by the you know the individual developers who are on Twitter all the time by the like series A startups many months faster than than you know than they will get adopted by like you know a like large enterprise that does food sales. Um there are a number of factors like you have to go through legal, you have to provision it for everyone. It has to you know like it has to pass security and compliance. The leaders of the company who are further away from the AI revolution you know are are forwardlooking but they have to say oh it makes sense for us to spend 50 million. This is what this claud code thing is. This is why it helps our company. This is why it makes us more productive. And then they have to explain to the people two levels below. and they have to say, "Okay, we have 3,000 developers. Like, here's how we're going to roll it out to our developers." And we have conversations like this every day. Like, you know, we are doing everything we can to make Anthropics revenue grow 20 or 30x a year instead of 10x a year. Um, you know, and and and again, you know, many enterprises are just saying this is so productive like, you know, we're going to take shortcuts in our usual procurement process, right? they're moving much faster than you know when we tried to sell them just the ordinary API which many of them use but quad code is a more compelling product um but it's not an infinitely compelling product and I don't think even AGI or powerful AI or country of geniuses in the data center will be an infinitely compelling product it will be a compelling product enough maybe to get three or five or 10x a year growth even when you're in the hundreds of billions of dollars which is extremely hard to do and has never been done in history before but not infinitely fast I I buy that it would be a slight slowdown and maybe this is not your claim but sometimes people talk about this like oh the capabilities are there but because of diffusion um otherwise like we're basically at AGI and then &gt;&gt; I I I don't believe we're basically at AGI. &gt;&gt; I think if you had the country of geniuses in a data center if your company didn't geniuses in a data center we would know it. We would know it if you had the country of geniuses in a data center like everyone in this room would know it. Everyone in Washington would know it. like you know people in rural rural parts might not know it but but but like we would know it we don't have that now that that's very clear as Dario was ending at to get generalization you need to train across a wide variety of realistic tasks and environments [music] for example with a sales agent the hardest part isn't teaching it to mash buttons in a specific database in Salesforce it's training the agent's judgment across ambiguous situations how do you sort through a database with thousands of leads to figure out which ones are How do you actually reach out? What do you do when you get ghosted? When an AI lab wanted to train a sales agent, Labelbox brought in dozens of Fortune 500 sales people to build a bunch of different RL environments. They created thousands of scenarios where the sales agent had to engage with the potential customer, which was roleplayed by a second AI. Limblebox made sure that this customer AI had a few different personas. Because when you cold call, you have no idea who's going to be on the other end. You need to be able to deal with a whole range of possibilities. Limblebox's sales experts monitored these conversations turn by [music] turn, tweaking the role playinging agent to ensure it did the kinds of things an actual customer would do. Label Box could iterate faster than anybody else in the industry. This is super important because RL is an empirical science. [music] It's not a solve problem. Labelbox has a bunch of tools for monitoring agent performance in real time. This lets their experts keep coming up with tasks so that the model stays in the right distribution of difficulty and [music] gets the optimal reward signal during training. Label box can do this sort of thing in almost every domain. They've got headphone managers, radiologists, even airline pilots. So, whatever you're working on, Labelbox [music] can help.

Coming back to concrete predictions because I think because there's so many different things to dis ambiguate, it can be easy to talk past each other when we're talking about capabilities. So, for example, when I interviewed 3 years ago, I asked her a prediction about what should we expect 3 years from now. I think you were right. So you said we should expect systems which if you talk to them for the course of an hour it's hard to tell them apart from a generally well educated human. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think you were right about that and I think spiritually I feel unsatisfied because my internal expectation was was that such a system could automate large parts of white collar work and so it might be more productive to talk about the actual end capabilities. You want such a system. &gt;&gt; So so I will I will I will basically tell you what what you know where where I think we are. So but let me let me ask it in a very specific question so that we can figure out exactly what kinds of capabilities we should expect soon. So maybe I'll ask about it in the context of a job I understand well not because it's the most relevant job but um just because I can evaluate the claims about it. Um take video editors right I have video editors and part of their invol job involves learning about our audience's preferences learning about my preferences and tastes and the different trade-offs we have and how just over the course of many months building up this understanding of context. And so the skill and ability they have six months into the job, a model that can pick up that skill on the job on the fly. When should we be expect such an AI system? Yeah. So I guess what you're talking about is like you know we've we're we're doing this interview for 3 hours and then like you know someone's going to come in, someone's going to edit it, they're going to be like oh you know you know I don't know Dario like you know scratched his head and you know we could we could edit that out and you magnify that. there was this like long there was this like long discussion that like is less interesting to people and then then you know then there's other thing that's like more interesting to people so you know let's let's let's kind of make this this edit so you know I think the country of geniuses in a data center w will be able to do that the the way it will be able to do that is you know it will have general control of a computer screen right like you know and and and you'll be able to feed this in and it'll be able to also use the computer screen to like go on the web look at all your previous look at all your previous interviews like look at what people are saying on Twitter in response to your interviews like talk to you ask you questions talk to your staff look at the history of kind of edits edits that you did and from that like do the job um so I think that's dependent on several things one that's dependent and and and and I think this is one of the things that's actually blocking deployment um getting to the point on computer use where the models are really masters at using the computer right and you know we've seen this climb in in benchmarks and benchmarks are always you know imperfect measures but like you know OS world is you know went from you know like 5% a you know like uh I think when we first re released you know uh uh computer use like a a year and a quarter ago it was like maybe 15% I don't remember exactly but we've climbed from that to like 65 or 70%. Um and and you know there may be harder measures as well but but I think computer use has to pass a point of reliability. Can I just ask to follow up on that before you move to the next point? Um I often for years I've been trying to build different internal LLM tools for myself and I often I have these text in text out tasks which should be dead center in the repertoire of these models and yet I still hire humans to do them just because it's if it's something like make identify what the best clips would be in this transcript and maybe they'll do like a seven out of 10 job at them but there's not this ongoing way I can engage with them to help them get better at the job the way I could with a human employee and so that missing ability even if you saw computer use would still block my ability to like offload an actual job to them. &gt;&gt; Again, there's there's this gets back to what to to kind to kind of what we were talking about before with learning on the job where it's it's very interesting. You know, I think I think with the coding agents like I don't think people would say that learning on the job is what is what is you know preventing the coding agents from like you know doing everything end to end like they keep they keep getting better. We have engineers at Enthropic who like don't write any code. And when I look at the productivity to your to your previous question, you know, we have folks who say this this GPU kernel, this chip, I used to write it myself. I just have Claude do it. And so there's this there's this enormous improvement in productivity. And I don't know like when I see Claude code like familiarity with the code base or like it you know or or a feeling that the model hasn't worked at the company for for a year that's not high up on the list of complaints I see. And so I think what I'm saying is we're we're like we're kind of taking a different path. Don't don't you think with coding that's because there is an external scaffold of memory which exists instantiated in the codebase which I don't know how many other jobs have coding made fast progress precisely because it has this unique um advantage that other economic activity doesn't &gt;&gt; but but when you say that what you're what you're implying is that by reading the code base into the context I have everything that the human needed to learn on the job. So that would be an example of whether it's written or not, whether it's available or not, a case where everything you needed to know, you got from the context window, right? And that and that what we think of as learning like, oh man, I started this job, it's going to take me 6 months to understand the codebase, the model just did it in the context. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I honestly don't know how to think about this because there there are people who qualitatively report what you're saying. Um there was a meter study I'm sure you saw last year where they &gt;&gt; had experienced developers try to close uh pull requests in repositories that they were familiar with and those developers reported an uplift. They they reported that they felt more productive with the use of these models but in fact if you look at their output and how much was actually merged back in there's a 20% downlift. They were less productive as a result of using these models. And so I'm trying to square the qualitative feeling that people feel with these models versus um one in a macro level where are all these where is this like renaissance of software and two when people do these independent evaluations why are we not seeing the creative benefits that we would expect &gt;&gt; within anthropic this is just really unambiguous right we're under an incredible amount of commercial pressure and make it even hard harder for ourselves because we have all this safety stuff we do that I think we do more than than than other companies so like the the the pressure to survive economically while also keeping our values is is just incredible, right? We're trying to keep this 10x revenue curve going. There's like there is zero time for There is zero time for feeling like we're productive when we're not. Like these tools make us a lot more productive. Like why why do you think we're concerned about competitors using the tools? because we think we're ahead of the competitors and like we don't we don't want to accel we we we we wouldn't be going through all this trouble if this was secretly reducing reducing our productivity like we see the end productivity every few months in the form of model launches like there's no kidding yourself about this like the models make you more productive &gt;&gt; um one that is people feeling like they're more productive is qualitatively predicted by studies like this but two if I Look at the end output. Obviously, you guys are making fast progress. But the fact, you know, the the the idea was supposed to be with recursive self-improvement is that you make a better AI, the AI helps you build a better next AI, etc., etc. And what I see instead, if I look at the you open AI, deep mind, is that people are just shifting around the podium every few months. And maybe you think that stops because you you won or whatever, but um but why why are we not seeing the person with the best coding model have this lasting advantage if in fact there are these enormous productivity gains from the last model? &gt;&gt; So no, no, no. I I I mean I mean I mean I think it's all like my my model of the situation is there's there's an advantage that's gradually growing. Like I would say right now the coding models give maybe I don't know a a like 15 maybe 20% total factor speed up like that's my view. Um uh and 6 months ago it was maybe 5%. And so and so it didn't matter like 5% doesn't register. It's now just getting to the point where it's like one of several factors that that kind of matters and and that's gonna that's going to keep speeding up. And so I think 6 months ago like you know there were several there were several companies that were at roughly the same point because uh you know this this wasn't uh this wasn't a notable factor but I think it's starting to speed up more and more. I you know I I would I would also say there are multiple companies that you know write models that are used for code and you know we're not perfectly good at you know preventing some of these other companies from from from using from from from kind of using our models internally. Um, so, uh, you know, I think I think everything we're kind kind of everything we're seeing is consistent with this kind of, um, this kind of snowball model where where, you know, there's no hard. Again, my my my my theme in all of this is like all of this is soft takeoff, like soft smooth exponentials, although the exponentials are relatively steep. And so and so we're seeing this snowball gather momentum where it's like 10% 20% 25% you know for 40% and as you go yeah AMD doll's law you have to get all the like things that are preventing you from from closing the loop out of the way but like this is one of the biggest priorities within anthropic. Um stepping back I think before in the stack we were talking about um well when do we get this on the job learning and it seems like the coding the point you were making the coding thing is we actually don't need on the job learning uh that you can have tremendous productivity improvements you can have potentially trillions of dollars of revenue for AI companies without this basic human abil maybe that's not your claim you should clarify um but without this basic human ability to learn on the job but I just look at like in in in most domain of economic activity. People say, "I hired somebody. They weren't that useful for the first few months and then over time they built up the context understanding. It's actually hard to define what we're talking about here, but they they got something and then now now they're they're a power horse and they're so valuable to us." And if AI doesn't develop this ability to learn on the fly, I'm not I'm a bit skeptical that we're going to see huge changes to the world without &gt;&gt; So I think I think I think two things here, right? There's the state of the technology right now um which is again we have these two stages. We have the pre-training and RL stage where you throw you throw a bunch of data and tasks into the models and then they generalize. So it's like learning but it's like learning from more data and and not you know not learning over kind of one human or one model's lifetime. So again this is situated between evolution and and and human learning. But once you learn all those skills, you have them. And and just like with pre-training, just how the models know more, you know, if if I look at a pre-trained model, you know, it knows more about the history of samurai in Japan than I do. It knows more about baseball than I do. It knows, you know, it knows more about, you know, lowass filters and electronics and, you know, all all of these things. Its knowledge is way broader than mine. So I think I think even even just that um you know may get us to the point where the models are better at you know kind of better at everything and then we also have again just with scaling the kind of existing setup we have the in context learning which I would describe as kind of like human on the job learning but like a little weaker and a little short term like you look at in context learning the you give the model a bunch of examples it does get it there's real learning that happens in context and like a million tokens is a lot. That's that's you know that can be days of human learning right you know if you think about the model you know you know kind of read reading reading a million words you know you know it takes me how long would it take me to read a million I mean you know like days or weeks at least um uh so you have these two things and and I think these two these two things within the existing paradigm may just be enough to get you the country of geniuses in the data center I don't know for sure but I think they're going to get you a large fraction of it there may be gaps but I I certainly think just as things are this I believe is enough to generate trillions of dollars of revenue. That's one that's all one. Two is this idea of continual learning. This idea of a single model learning on the job. Um I think we're working on that too and I think there's a good chance that in the next year or two we also make we also solve that. Um I I again I I I I you know I think you get most of the way there without it. I think the trillions of dollars of of you know the the I think the trillions of dollars a year market maybe all the national security implications and the safety implications that I wrote about in adolescence of technology can happen without it. But I I I also think we and I imagine others are working on it. And I think there's a good chance that that you know that we get there within the next year or two. There are a bunch of ideas. I won't go into all of them in detail, but um you know, one is just make the context longer. There's there's nothing preventing longer context from working. You just have to train at longer context and then learn to to serve them at inference. And both of those are engineering problems that we are working on and that I would assume others are working on as well. Yeah. So this context length increase, it seemed like there was a period from 2020 to 2023 where from GPD3 to GP4 Turbo, there was an increase from like 2,000 context lines to 128K. I feel like for the next for the twoish years since then, we've been in the sameish ballpark. Yeah. And when model context lines get much longer than that, people report qualitative degradation in the ability of the model to consider that full context. Um, so I'm curious what you're internally seeing that makes you think like, oh, 10 million context, 100 million contexts to get human like six months learning billion. &gt;&gt; This isn't a research problem. This is a this is an engineering and inference problem, right? If you want to serve long context, you have to like store your entire KV cache. You have to, you know, um, uh, you know, it's it's it's it's difficult to store all the memory in the GPUs to juggle the memory around. I don't even know the detail, you know, at this point. this is at a level of detail that that that that I'm no longer able to follow although you know I I knew it in the GPD3 era of like you know these are the weights these are the activations you have to store um uh but you know you know these days the whole thing has flipped because we have models and and and kind of all of that but um uh and and this degradation you're talking about like again without getting too specific like a question I would ask is like there's two things there's the context length you train at and there's a context length that you serve at if If you train at a small context length and then try to serve at a long context length like maybe you get these degradations. &gt;&gt; It's better than nothing. You might still offer it but you get these degradations and maybe it's harder to train at a long context length. Yeah. So, you know, there's there's a lot I I I want to at the same time ask about like maybe some rabbit holes of like well wouldn't you expect that if you had to train on longer context length that would mean that um you're able to get sort of like less samples in for the same amount of compute. But before maybe it's not worth diving deep on that. I I want to get an answer to the bigger picture question, which is like, okay, so um I don't feel a preference for a human editor that's been working for me for 6 months versus an AI that's been working with me for 6 months. What year do you predict that that will be the case? &gt;&gt; I my I mean, you know, my guess for that is, you know, there's there's a lot of problems that are basically like we can do this when we have the country of geniuses in a data center. Um, and so, you know, my my my my picture for that is, you know, again, if you if you if you if you know, if you made me guess, it's like one to two years, maybe one to three years. It's really hard to tell. I have a I have a strong view 99 95% that like all this will happen in 10 years. Like that's I think that's just a super safe bet. And then I have a hunch this is more like a 50/50 thing that it's going to be more like 1 to two, maybe more like 1 to three. &gt;&gt; So 1 to three years. country of genius says um and then the slightly less economically valuable task of editing videos [laughter] I &gt;&gt; it seems pretty economically valuable let me tell you it's just there are a lot of use cases like that right there are a lot of similar ones so you're predicting that within 1 to 3 years um and in gerally enthropic has predicted that by late 26 early 27 we will have AI systems that are quote um have the ability to navigate interfaces available to humans doing digital work today intellectual capabilities matching or exceeding that of Nobel prize winners and the ability to interface with the physical world. And then you gave an interview two months ago with Dealbook where you were emphasizing your um your company's more responsible comput scaling as compared to your competitors. And I'm trying to square these two views where if you really believe that we're going to have a country of geniuses, you you want as big a data center as you can get, there's no reason to slow down. The TAM of a Nobel Prize winner that is actually can do everything a Nobel Prize winner can do is like trillions of dollars. And so I'm trying to square this conservatism uh which seems rational if you have more moderate timelines with your stated views about AI progress. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So so it actually all fits together and and we go back to this fast but not infinitely fast diffusion. So like let's say that we're making progress at this rate. Um you know the the the technology is making progress this fast. Again, I have, you know, very high conviction that like it's going, you know, the the, you know, we're going to get there within within a few years. I have a hunch that we're going to get there within a year or two. So, a little uncertainty on the technical side, but like, you know, pretty pretty strong confidence that it won't be off by much. What I'm less certain about is again the economic diffusion side. Like I really do believe that we could have models that are a country of geniuses country of geniuses in a data center in one to two years. One question is how many years after that do the trillions in you know do do the do the trillions in revenue start rolling in? Um I don't think it's guaranteed that it's going to be immediate. Um, you know, I think it could be um one year, it could be two years, I could even stretch it to five years, although I'm like I'm skeptical of that. And so we have this uncertainty which is even if the technology goes as fast as I suspect that it will, we we don't know exactly how fast it's going to drive revenue. We we know it's coming, but with the way you buy these data centers, if you're off by a couple years, that can be ruinous. It is just like how I wrote, you know, in machines of loving grace, I said, look, I think we might get this powerful AI, this country of genius in the data center. That description you gave comes from the machines of loving grace. I said, we'll get that 2026, maybe 2027. Again, that is that is my hunch. Wouldn't be surprised if I'm off by a year or two, but like that is my hunch. Let's say that happens. That's the starting gun. How long does it take to cure all the diseases, right? That's that's one of the ways that like drives a huge amount of of of of economic value, right? Like you cure you cure every disease. You know, there's a question of how much of that goes to the pharmaceutical company to the AI company, but there's an enormous consumer surplus because everyone, you know, assuming we can get access for everyone, which I care about greatly. We, you know, we we cure all of these diseases. How long does it take? You have to do the biological discovery. you have to, you know, go you have to, you know, manufacture the new drug. You have to, you know, go through the regulatory process. I mean, we saw this with like vaccines and COVID, right? Like it there's just this we we got the vaccine out to everyone, but it took a year and a half, right? And and so my question is, how long does it take to get the cure for everything, which AI is the genius that can in theory invent out to everyone? How long from when that AI first exists in the lab to when diseases have actually been cured for everyone right in in you know we've had a polio vaccine for 50 years we're still trying to eradicate it in the most remote corners of Africa and you know the Gateson nation is trying as hard as they can others are trying as hard as they can but you know that's difficult again I you know I don't expect most of the economic diffusion to be as difficult as that right that's like the most difficult case but but there's a There's a real dilemma here and and where I've settled on it is it will be it will be a it will be faster than anything we've seen in the world but it still has its limits and and so then when we go to buying data centers you know you again again again the curve I'm looking at is okay we you know we've had a 10x a year increase every year so beginning of this year we're looking at 10 billion in in in annual in you know rate of annual ize revenue at the beginning of the year. We have to decide how much compute to buy. Um and you know it takes a year or two to actually build out the data centers to reserve the data centers. So basically I'm saying like in uh 2027 how much compute do I get? Well I could assume um uh that uh the uh revenue will continue growing 10x a year. So it'll be uh one uh one uh 100 billion at the end of 2026 and 1 trillion at the end of 2027. And so I could buy a trillion dollar actually would be like5 trillion dollars of compute because it would be a trillion dollar a year for for five years, right? I could buy a trillion dollars of compute that starts at the end of 2027. And if my if my revenue is not a trillion dollars, if it's even 800 billion, there's no force on earth, there's there's no hedge on earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I if I buy that much compute. And and so even though a part of my brain wonders if it's going to keep growing 10x, I can't buy a trillion dollars a year of compute in in in in in in in 2027. If I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth, or if the the growth rate is 5x a year instead of 10x a year, then then you know that you go bankrupt. Um and and and so you end up in a world where you know you're supporting hundreds of billions not trillions and you accept you accept some risk that there's so much demand that you can't support the revenue and you accept still some risk that you know you got it wrong and it still slow and so when I talked about behaving responsibly what I meant actually was not the absolute amount that that actually was not um you know I think it is true we're spending somewhat less than some of the other players. It's actually the other things like have we been thoughtful about it or are we yoloing and saying, "Oh, we're going to do $100 billion here, hundred billion dollars there." I kind of get the impression that, you know, some of the other companies have not written down the spreadsheet that they don't really understand the risk they're taking. They're just kind of doing stuff because it sounds cool. Um uh and and we've thought carefully about it, right? We're an enterprise business. Therefore, you know, we can rely more on revenue. It's less fickle than consumer. We have better margins, which is the buffer between buying too much and buying too little. And so, I think we bought an amount that allows us to capture pretty strong upside worlds. It won't capture the full 10x a year. Um, and things would have to go pretty badly for us to be for us to be in financial trouble. So, I think we've thought carefully and we've made that balance. And and that's what I mean when I say that we're being responsible. Okay. So, it seems like um it's possible that we're we actually just have different definitions of the country of a genius in a data center because when I think of like actual human geniuses, an actual country of human geniuses in a data center, I'm like I would happily buy $5 trillion worth of compute to run actual country of human genius in a data center. So, let's say JP Morgan or Madna or whatever doesn't want to use them. Also, I've got a country of geniuses. they they'll start their own company and if like they they can't start their own company and they're bottlenecked by clinical trials. It is worth stating with clinical trials like most clinical trials fail because the drug doesn't work. There's not efficacy, right? &gt;&gt; And I make exactly that point in in machines of love and grace. I say the clinical trials are going to go much faster than we're used to, but not not instant not infinitely fast. &gt;&gt; And then suppose it takes a year to for the clinical trials to work out so that you're getting revenue from that and you can make more drugs. Okay. Hey, well, you've got a country of geniuses and you're an AI lab and you have you could use uh many more AI researchers. Um, you also think that there's these like self-reinforcing gains from, you know, smart people working on AI tech. So, like, okay, you can have the right you can have the data center working on like AI progress. &gt;&gt; Is there more gains from buying &gt;&gt; like substantially more gains from buying a trillion dollars a year of compute versus $300 billion a year of compute? If your competitor is buying a trillion, yes, there is. &gt;&gt; Well, no, there's some gain, but then but again, there's this chance that they go bankrupt before, you know, be again, if you're off by only a year, you destroy yourselves. That's the That's the balance. We're buying a lot. We're buying a hell of a lot. Like, we're not we're you know, we're buying an amount that's comparable to that that, you know, the the the the biggest players in the game are buying. Um but but if you're asking me why why haven't we signed you know 10 10 trillion of compute starting in starting in mid 2027 first of all it can't be produced there isn't that much in the world um uh but but second um what if the country of geniuses comes but it comes in mid 2028 instead of mid2027 you go bankrupt. So if your projection is 1 to 3 years, it seems like you should want $10 trillion of compute by um 2029 2020 maybe 2020 latest &gt;&gt; like I mean you know you are like it seems like even in your the longest version of the timelines you state the compute you are ramping up to build doesn't seem &gt;&gt; in accordance what what makes you think that &gt;&gt; well as you said you would want the 10 trillion the human wages let's say are um on the order of 50 trillion a year &gt;&gt; if you look at so so I won't I won't talk about entropic in particular but if you talk about the industry like um the amount of compute the industry had you know the the the the amount of compute the industry is building this year is probably in the you know I don't know very low tens of you know call it 10 15 gawatts next year I you know it goes up by roughly 3x a year so like next year's 30 or 40 gigawatts and um 2028 might be 100 202 might like three 300 gigawatts and like each gigawatt costs like um maybe 10 I mean I'm doing the math in my head but each gigawatt costs maybe 10 billion you know order 10 to 15 billion a year so you know you kind of you you know you put that all together and you're getting about about what you described you're getting multiple trillions a year by 2028 or 2029 so you're you're getting exactly that you're getting you're getting exactly what you predict &gt;&gt; um that's for the industry &gt;&gt; that that's for the industry That's right. So suppose anthropics comput keeps 3xing a year and then by like 27 you have uh or 27 28 you have 10 gawatt and like multiply that by as you say um 10 billion. So then it's like 100 billion a year but then you were saying the TAM by 2028. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to give exact numbers for anthropic but but these numbers are too small. These numbers are too small. &gt;&gt; Okay. Interesting. I'm really proud that the puzzles I've worked on with Jane Street have resulted in them hiring a bunch of people for my audience. Well, they're still hiring and they just sent me another puzzle. For this one, they spent about 20,000 GPU hours training backd doors into three different language models. Each one has a hidden prompt that elicits completely different behavior. You just have to find the trigger. This is particularly cool because finding backd doorors is actually an open question in Frontier AI research. Enthropic actually released a couple of papers about sleep agents and they showed that you can build a simple classifier on the residual stream to detect when a back door is about to fire, [music] but they already knew what the triggers were because they built them. Here you don't. And it's not feasible to check the activations for all possible trigger [music] phrases. Unlike the other puzzles they made for this podcast, Jane Street isn't even sure this one is solvable, but they've set aside $50,000 for the [music] best attempts and write-ups. The puzzle's live at janestreet.com/themarcash and they're accepting submissions until April 1st. All right, back to Dario. You've told investors that you plan to be profitable starting 28 and this is the year where we're like potentially getting the country of geniuses at a data center and you know this is like going to now unlock all this uh progress and uh medicine and uh health and etc etc and new technologies. Wouldn't this be a particular exactly the time where you'd like want to reinvest in the business and build bigger countries so they can make more discoveries? &gt;&gt; So I mean profit profitability is this kind of like weird thing in this field. I I like like I don't think I I don't think in this field profitability is actually a measure of uh um you know kind of spending down versus investing in the business like let's let's just let's just take a model of this. I actually think profitability happens when you underestimated the amount of demand you were going to get and loss happens when you overestimated the amount of demand you were going to get. Um because you're buying the data centers ahead of time. So think about it this way. Um ideally you would like and again these are stylized facts. These numbers are not exact for I'm just trying to make a toy model here. Let's say half of your compute is for training and half of your compute is for inference. Um, and you know the inference has some gross margin that's like more than 50%. Um, and so what that means is that if you were in steady state, you build a data center, if you knew exactly exactly exactly the demand you were getting, you would um uh uh uh you know you would you would you you would you would get a certain amount of revenue. say, I don't know, uh, uh, let's say you pay $100 billion a year for compute and on $50 billion a year, you support $150 billion on of of of of revenue and the other 50 billion the other 50 billion are used for training. Um, so basically, you're profitable. You make you make you make $50 billion of profit. Those are the economics of the industry today or or sorry, not today, but like that's where we're where we're projecting forward in a year or two. The only thing that makes that not the case is if you get less demand than 50 billion um then you have more than 50% of your your data center for research and you're not profitable. So you you know you train stronger models but you're like not profitable. Um if you uh get more demand than you thought then your research gets squeezed um but uh you know you're you're you're kind of able to support more inference and you're more profitable. So it's maybe I'm not explaining it well but but the thing I'm trying to say is you decide the amount of compute first and then you have some target desire of of inference versus versus training but that gets determined by demand. It doesn't get determined by &gt;&gt; what I'm hearing is the reason you're predicting profit is that you are systematically underestimate uh underinvesting in compute right because if you actually &gt;&gt; No I'm saying I'm saying it's hard to predict. So, so these things about 2028 and when it will happen, that's our that's our attempt to do the best we can with investors, all of this stuff is really uncertain because of the cone of uncertainty. Like we could be profitable in 2026 if the if the revenue grows fast enough and then and then um uh you know if we if we overestimate or underestimate the next year that could swing wildly. Like I I I what I'm trying to get at is you have a model in your head of like the the business invests invests invests invests gets scale and and and and kind of then becomes profitable. There's a single point at which things turn around. I don't think the economics of this industry work that way. &gt;&gt; I see. So if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying because of the discrepancy between the amount of compute we should have gotten and the amount of compute we got, we we were like sort of forced to make profit. But that that doesn't mean we're going to continue making profit. But we're going to like reinvest the money because well now AI has made so much progress and we want the bigger country of geniuses and so then back into uh revenue is high but losses are also high. If we if we predict if every year we predict exactly what the demand is going to be will be profitable every year because grow because spending spending 50% of your compute on on 50% of your compute on research roughly um plus a gross margin that's higher than 50%. And and correct demand prediction leads to profit. That's the prof that's that's the profitable business model that I think is kind of like there but like obsc obscured by these like building ahead and prediction errors. I &gt;&gt; I guess you're treating the 50% as a uh as a sort of like you know just like a given constant whereas you in fact if you if AI progress is fast and you can increase the progress by scaling up more you just have more than 50% and not make profit. &gt;&gt; Here's what I'll say. You might want to scale up it more. you might want to scale it up more, but but but you know, remember the log returns to scale, right? If if 70% would get you a very little bit of a smaller model through a factor of of 1.4x, right? like that extra $20 billion is is is is you know that each each dollar there is worth much less to you because because the log linear setup and so you might find that it's better to invest that that that that it's better to invest that $20 billion in you know in in serving inference or in hiring engineers who are who who are kind of better who are who are kind of better who are kind of better at what they're doing. So the the reason I said 50% that's not that's not exactly our target. It's not exactly going to be 50%. It will probably vary vary over time. What what I'm saying is the the the the like log linear return what it leads to is you spend of order one fraction of the business, right? Like not 5% not 95%. And then it then you know then then then you get diminishing returns because of the because the walls that I'm like convincing Dario to like believe in AI progress or something but like uh okay you you don't invest in research because it has diminishing returns but you invest in the other things you mentioned &gt;&gt; again again we're talking about diminishing returns after you're spending 50 billion a year right like this is a point I'm sure you would make but like diminishing returns on a genius is could be quite high and more generally like what is profit put in a market economy profit is basically saying the other companies in the market can like do more things with this money that I &gt;&gt; yeah put aside entropic I'm just trying to like because I you know I don't want to give information about entropic is why I'm giving these stylized numbers but like let's just derive the equilibrium of the industry right I think the so so so why doesn't everyone spend 100% of their um uh you know 100% of their compute on training and not serve any customers right it's because if They didn't get any revenue. They couldn't raise money. They couldn't do comput deals. They couldn't buy more compute the next year. So, there's going to be an equilibrium where every every company spends less than 100% on on on on on training and certainly less than 100% on inference. It should be clear why you don't just serve the current models and and you know and and and never train another model because then you don't have any demand because you because you'll fall behind. So, there's some equilibrium. It's it's not going to be 10%, it's not going to be 90%. Let's just say as a stylized fact it's 50%. That's what I'm getting at. And and and I think we're going to be in a position where that equilibrium of how much you spend on training is less than the gross margins that that you're that that that you're able to get on compute. And so the the the the underlying economics are profitable. The problem is you have this this hellish demand prediction problem when you're when you're buying the next year of compute and you might guess under and be very profitable but have no compute for research or you might guess over and you know you're you're you're um uh you you are not profitable and you have all the compute compute for research in the world. &gt;&gt; Does does that make sense just as a dynamic model of the industry? May maybe stepping back I'm like uh I I I'm not saying I I think the country of genius is going to come in two years and therefore you should buy this compute. Um to me what you're saying the end conclusion you're arriving at makes a lot of sense but uh that's because like oh it seems like country geniuses is hard and there's a long way to go. And so the stepping back the thing I'm trying to get at is more like it seems like your worldview is compatible with somebody who says uh we're like 10 years away from a world in which like we're generating trillions of dollars. &gt;&gt; That's just that's just not my view. That is that is not my view. Like I I so so I'll like I'll like make another prediction. It is hard for me to see that that there won't be trillions of dollars in revenue before 2030. Um like uh I can I can construct a plausible world. It takes maybe three years. So that that you know that would be the end of what I think it's plausible like in 2028 we get the the real country of geniuses in a data center. You know the revenue's been been go you know the revenue has been going into the maybe is is in the low hundreds of billions by by by by 2028 and and and then the country of geniuses accelerates it to trillions, you know, and and we're basically we're basically on the slow end of diffusion. It takes two years to get to the trillions. that that that would that that that would be the world where it takes until that would be the world where it takes until 2030. I I I suspect even composing the technical exponential and the diffusion exponential will get there before 2030. So you laid out a model where anthropic makes profit because it seems like fundamentally we're in a computed world and so it's like eventually we keep growing comput. Well, I think I think the way the profit comes is again and and you know, let's let's just abstract the whole industry here. Like we have a you know, let's just imagine we're we're in like an economics textbook. We have a small number of firms each can invest a limited amount in you know or or or like each can invest some fra fraction in R&amp;D. They have some marginal cost to serve. the margins on that the profit mar the gross profit margins on that marginal cost are like very high because because because because inference is efficient there's some competition but the models are also differentiated there's some there's some um you know companies will compete to push their research budgets up but like because there's a small number of players you know we have the what is it called in the corno equilibrium I think is what the what the small number of firm equilibrium is it the point is it it doesn't equilibrate to perfect competition with with with with with with zero margins. If there's like three firms, if there's three firms in the economy, all are kind of independently behaving behaving rationally, it doesn't equilibrate to zero. &gt;&gt; Um, help me understand that because right now we do have three leading firms and they're not making profit. Um, and so what what uh yeah, what what is changing? Yeah. So the the again the gross margins right now are very positive. What's happen what what's happening is a combination of two things. One is we're still in the exponential scale up phase of compute. Um, so what basically what that means is we're training like a model gets trained, it costs, you know, let's say a model got trained that costs uh a billion last year. Um, and then uh this year it produced uh $4 billion of revenue and cost $1 billion to to uh to to to inference from. Um so you know again I'm using stylized number here but you know that would be 75% you know gross gross gross margins and you know this this 25% tax. So that model as a whole makes $2 billion. Um but at the same time we're spending $10 billion to train the next model because there's an exponential scale up and so the company loses money. Each model makes money but the company loses money. The equilibrium I'm talking about is an equilibrium where we have the country of geniuses. We have the country of geniuses in a data center, but that that um model training scale up has equilibrated more. Maybe maybe it's still it's still going up. We're still trying to predict the demand, but it's more it's more um leveled out. Um I'll give you a couple things there. So, um let's start with the current world. Um in the current world, you're right that as you said before, if you treat each individual model as a company, it's profitable. But of course, a big part of the production function of being a frontier lab is training the next model, right? So if you didn't do that, then you'd make profit for two months and then you wouldn't have margins because you wouldn't have the best model and then so yeah, you can make profits for two months on the current at some point that reaches the biggest scale that it can reach and then and then in equilibrium we have algorithmic improvements, but we're spending roughly the same amount to train the next model as as as we spent to train the current model. Um so this equilibrium relies &gt;&gt; I mean at some point at some at at some point you run out of money in the economy &gt;&gt; uh a fixed lump of labor files the economy is going to grow right that's one of your predictions we're going to have but this is but this is another example of the theme I was talking about which is that the economy will grow much faster with AI than I think it ever has before but it's not like right now the compute is growing 3x a year I don't believe the economy is going to grow 300% % a year. Like I said this in Machines of Loving Grace, like I think we we may get 10 or 20% per year growth in the economy, but we're not going to get 300% growth in the economy. So I think I think in the end, you know, if if compute becomes the majority of what the economy produces, it's it's going to be capped by that. So okay, now let's assume a model where compute stays capped. Yeah. Um, the world where Frontier Labs are making money is one where they continue to make um, fast progress because fundamentally your margin is limited by how good the alternative is. And so you are able to make money because you have a frontier model. Um, if you didn't have frontier model, you wouldn't be making money. Um, &gt;&gt; and and so this this model requires there never to be a steady state like forever and ever you keep making more progress. &gt;&gt; I don't think that's true. True. I mean I I feel feel like we're we're like we're talk we're we're you know I feel like this is an economics uh like uh you know this is like an economics class you know quote we never stop talking about economics. &gt;&gt; We never we never stop talking about economics. So no but but there there are worlds in which um you know there so I I don't think this field's going to be a I don't think this field's going to be a monopoly. All my lawyers never want me to say the word monopoly. Um but I don't think this field's going to be a monopoly. But but you do get you get industries in which there are small number of players, not one but a small number of players. And ordinarily like the the way you get monopolies like Facebook or or Meta, I always call them Facebook but um uh uh is is these kind of is these kind of these kind of network effects. The way you get industries in which there are small number of players are very high costs of entry, right? Um so you know uh cloud is like this. I think cloud is a good example of this. You have three maybe four players within cloud. I think I think that's the same for AI. Three maybe four. Um uh and the reason is that it's it's so expensive. It requires so much expertise and so much capital to like run a cloud company, right? And so you have to put up all this capital. And then in addition to putting up all this capital, you have to get all of this other stuff that like, you know, requires a lot of skill to, you know, to make it happen. And so it's like if you go to someone and you're like, I want to disrupt this industry. Here's hundred billion dollars. You're like, okay, I'm putting $100 billion and also betting that you can do all these other things that these people have been doing &gt;&gt; decrease the profit in the industry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and and then and then the effect of your entering is the profit margins go down. And so you know we have equilibria like this all the time in the economy where we have a few we have a few players profits are not astronomical margins are not astronomical but they're they're not zero right um uh and and you know I think I think that's what we see on cloud cloud is very undifferentiated models are more differentiated than cloud right like everyone knows claude is claude claude is good at different things than GPT is good at is than than Gemini is good at and it's not just claude's good at coding GP PT is good at you know math and reasoning you know um uh it's more subtle than that like models are good at different types of coding models have different styles like I think I think these things are actually you know quite different from each other and so I would expect more differentiation than you see in in um cloud now there there actually is a uh counter there there there is one counterargument um and that counterargument is that if all of that the process of producing models um becomes uh if AI models can do that themselves, then that could spread throughout the economy. But that is not an argument for commoditizing AI models in general. That's kind of an argument for commoditizing the whole economy at once. Um I don't know what what quite happens in that world where basically anyone can do anything, anyone can build anything, and there's like no mode around anything at all. I mean, I don't know, maybe we want that world like like maybe that's the maybe that's the end state here. like maybe maybe um you know when maybe when when when kind of AI models can do you know when when when when AI models can do everything if we've solved all the safety and security problems like you know that's one of the one of the one of the mechanisms for for uh you know um uh uh you know just just kind of the economy flattening itself again but but that's kind of like post like far post country of geniuses in a data center. Um maybe a finer way to put that uh potential point is one um it seems like AI research is especially loaded on raw intellectual power which will be especially abundant in a world with AGI and two if you just look at the world today there's very few technologies that seem to be diffusing as fast as um as AI algorithmic progress and so that does hint that this industry is sort of structurally diffusive So I think coding is going fast but I think AI research is a supererset of coding and there are aspects of it that are not going fast. Um uh but I but I do think again once we get coding once we get AI models going fast then you know AI you know that will speed up the ability of AI models to kind to kind of do everything else. So I think while coding is going fast now I think once the AI models are building the next AI models and building everything else the kind of whole the whole economy will kind of go at the same pace. I am I am worried geographically though. I'm a little worried that like just proximity to AI having heard about AI um uh that that that may be one differentiator. And so when I said the like you know 10 or 20% growth rate a worry I have is that the growth rate could be like 50% in Silicon Valley and you know parts of the world that are kind of socially connected to Silicon Valley and you know not that much faster than its current pace elsewhere and I think that'd be a pretty messed up world. So I one of the things I think about a lot is how to prevent that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you think that once we have uh this country of geniuses in a data center that robotics is sort of quickly solved afterwards because it seems like a big problem with robotics is that um a human can learn how to teleoperate current hardware but current AI models can't at least not not in a way that's super productive and so if we have this ability to learn like a human should it solve robotics immediately as well &gt;&gt; I don't think it's dependent on learning like a human it could happen in different ways again we could have trained the model on many different video games which like robotic controls or many different simulated robotics environments or just you know train them to control computer screens and they learn to generalize. So it will happen. It's not necessarily dependent on humanlike learning. Humanlike learning is one way it could happen. If the model's like, "Oh, I pick up a robot. I don't know how to use it. I learn that. That could happen because we discovered discovering continual learning." That could also happen because we train the model on a bunch of environments and then it generalized. Or it could happen because the model learns that in the context length. It it doesn't actually matter which way. If we go back to the discussion we had like like an hour ago, that type of thing can happen in that type of thing can happen in several different ways. Um uh uh but but I do think when for for whatever reason the models have those skills then uh robotics will be revolutionized both the design of robots because the models will be much better than humans at that um and also the the ability to kind of control robots. So we'll get better at the physical building the physical hardware building the physical robots and we'll also get better at controlling it. Now you know does that mean the robotics industry will also be generating trillions of dollars of revenue? My answer there is yes but there will be the same extremely fast but not infinitely fast diffusion. So will robotics be be revolutionized? Yeah, maybe tack on another year or two. &gt;&gt; That's that's my that's the way I think about these things. Uh there's a general skepticism about extremely fast progress. Like here here's my view which is like it sounds like you are going to solve continual learning one way or another within a matter of years. But just as people weren't talking about continual learning a couple years ago and then we realized oh why aren't these models as useful as they could be right now even though they are clearly passing the touring test and are experts in so many different domains. Maybe it's this thing. And then we solve this thing and we realize actually there's another um another thing that human intelligence can do. that's a basis of human labor that these models can't do. And then so why not think there will be more things like this? Why I think that like we're we're you know we've like found the pieces of human intelligence. &gt;&gt; Well well to be clear I mean I think continual learning as I've said before might not be a barrier at all right like like you know I think I think we maybe just get there by pre-training generalization and and and and and and RL generalization. Like I I think there just might not be um there basically might not be such a thing at all. In fact, I would point to the history in in ML of people coming up with things that are barriers that end up kind of dissolving within the big blob of compute, right? That, you know, people talked about, you know, you know, how do you have, you know, how do how do your models keep track of nouns and verbs and, you know, how do they, you know, they can understand semant syntactically, but they can't understand semantically. You know, it's only statistical correlations. You can understand a paragraph, but you can't understand a word. There's reasoning, you can't do reasoning, but then suddenly it turns out you can do code and math very well at all. So &gt;&gt; I I think there actually there's there's actually a stronger history of some of these things seeming like a big deal and then and then kind of and then kind of dissolving. Some of them are real. I mean the need for data is real. May maybe continual continual learn continual learning is a real thing. But again, I would ground us in something like code. Like I think we may get to the point in like a year or two where the models can just do end to end. Like that's a whole task. That's a whole sphere of human activity that that we're just saying models can do it now. Um when you say end to end, do you mean um setting technical direction, understanding the context of the problem, etc.? Okay. Yes. I mean all of that. Interesting. I mean that that is I feel like AGI complete um which maybe is internally consistent but um it's not like saying 90% of code or 100% of code it's like no no the other parts of the &gt;&gt; no no I gave this I gave the spectrum 90% of code 100% of code 90% of N10 suite 100% of N10 suite new tasks are created for SWES eventually those get done as well but it's a long spectrum there but we're traversing the spectrum very quickly &gt;&gt; um I do think it's funny that I I've seen a couple podcasts you've done where um the host will be like a butcher wrote the essay about the control learning thing and it always makes me crack up because you're like you know you've been an AI researcher for like 10 years and I'm sure there's like some uh feeling of like okay so podcaster wrote an essay [laughter] like every interview I get asked about it &gt;&gt; you know the the truth of the truth of the matter is that we're all trying to figure this out together right there there are some ways in which I'm able to see things that others aren't these days That probably has more to do with like I can see a bunch of stuff within Enthropic and have to make a bunch of decisions than I have any great research insight that that that others don't. Right? I you know I'm running a 2500 person company. Like it's it's actually pretty hard for me to have have concrete research insight you know much harder than you know than than it would have been you know 10 years ago or or you know or even two or three years ago. Um, as we go towards a world of a full drop in remote worker replacement, does a API pricing model still make the most sense? And if not, what is the correct way to price AGI or serve AGI? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think there's going to be a bunch of different business models here sort of all at once that are going to be that are going to be experimented with. Um, I I I actually do think that the the API um model is is more durable than many people think. Um, one way I think about it is if the technology is kind of advancing quickly, if it's advancing exponentially, what that means is there's there's always kind of like a surface area of of kind of new use cases that have been developed in in the last uh in the last three months. And any kind of product surface you put in place is always at risk of sort of becoming irrelevant, right? Any given product surface probably makes sense for, you know, a range of capabilities of the model, right? The the chatbot is already running into limitations of, you know, making it smarter doesn't really help the average consumer that much. But I don't think that's a limitation of AI models. I don't think that's evidence that, you know, the models are are the models are good enough and they're they're, you know, them getting better doesn't matter to the economy. It doesn't matter to that particular product. Um, and and so I think the value of the API is the API always offers an opportunity, you know, very close to the bare metal to build on what the latest thing is. Um, and so there, you know, there's there's there's kind of always going to be this, you know, this this kind of front of new startups and new ideas that weren't possible a few months ago and are possible because the model is advancing. And and so I I actually I I I kind of actually predict that we are it's going to exist alongside other models, but we're always going to have the API business model because there's there's always going to be a need for a thousand different people to try experimenting with the model in different way and a hundred of them become startups and 10 of them become big successful startups and you know two or three really end up being the the way that people use the model of a of a given generation. So I I basically think it's always going to exist. At the same time, I'm sure there's going to be other models as well. Like not every token [snorts] that's output by the model is worth the same amount. Think about, you know, how how what is the value of the tokens that are like, you know, that the model outputs when someone, you know, call, you know, someone, you know, calls them up and says, "My Mac isn't working or something." You know, the model's like, "Restart it, right?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; And like you know someone hasn't heard that before but like you know the model said that like 10 million times you know that maybe that's worth like a dollar or a few cents or something. Um whereas if uh the model you know the model goes to you know one of the one of the pharmaceutical companies and it says oh you know this molecule you're developing you should take the aromatic ring from that end of the molecule and put it on that end of the molecule. Um and and you know if you do that wonderful things will happen. um uh like like those tokens could [laughter] be worth, you know, tens of millions of dollars, right? Um uh so so I think we're definitely going to see business models that that recognize that, you know, at some point we're going to see, you know, pay for results or you know, in some in some form or we may see forms of compensation that are like labor um uh you know, that that kind of work by the hour. Um I I I you know, I don't Oh, I think I think I think because it's a new industry, a lot of things are going to be tried and I you know I don't know what will turn out to be the right thing. &gt;&gt; Um what I find uh I I take your point that people will have to try things to figure out what is the best way to use this blob of intelligence. But what I find striking is clawed code. So I don't think in the history of startups there has been a single application that has been as hotly competed in as coding agents and um and and cloud code is a category leader here and that seems surprising to me like it doesn't seem intrinsically like enthropic had to build this and I wonder if you have an accounting of why it had to be enthropic or why how enthropic ended up building an application in addition to the model underlying it. Yeah. So it actually happened in a pretty simple way which is we had our own um you know we had our coding models which were good at coding and and you know around the beginning of 2025 I said I I think the time has come where you can have non-trivial acceleration of your own research um if you're an AI company by using these models and of course you know we you need an interface you need a harness to use them and so I encourage people internally you know I didn't say this is one thing that you know you have to use. I I just said people should experiment with this and then you know this thing I think it might have been originally called claude CLI and then the name eventually got changed to cloud code internally um was the thing that kind of everyone was using and it was seeing fast internal adoption and I looked at it and I said probably we should launch this externally right um uh you know it's it's seen such fast adoption within anthropic like you know like you know coding is a lot of what we do and and so you know we have a we have audience of many many hundreds of people that's in some ways at least representative of the external audience. So it looks like we already have product market fit. Let's launch this thing. Um and and then we launched it and and and I think you know just just the fact that we ourselves are kind of developing the model and we ourselves know what we most need to use the model. I think it's it's kind of creating this feedback loop. &gt;&gt; I see. in the sense that you let's say a developer at Enthropic is like ah it it would be better if it was better at this X thing and then you bake that into the next model that you build that that's that's one version of it but but then there's just the ordinary product iteration of like you know we have a bunch of we have a bunch of coders within anthropic like we um you know they like use cloud code every day and so we get fast feedback that was more important in the early days now of course there are millions of people using it um and so we get a bunch of external feedback as well. But it's, you know, it's just great to be able to get, you know, kind of kind of uh um fast fast internal feedback. You know, I think this is the reason why we launched a coding model and, you know, didn't launch a pharmaceutical company, right? It you know, you know, my background is in in my background's in in like biology, but like we don't have any of the resources that are needed to launch a pharmaceutical company. So, there's been a ton of hype around OpenClaw, and I wanted to check it out for myself. I've got a day coming up this weekend and I don't have anything planned yet. So, I gave Open Claw a Mercury debit card. I set a couple hundred limit and I said, "Surprise me." Okay, so here's the Mac Mini it's on. And besides having access to my Mercury, it's totally quarantined. They actually felt quite comfortable giving it access to a debit card because Mercury makes it super easy to set up guardrails. I was able to customize permissions, cap the spend, and restrict the category of purchases. I wanted to make sure the debit card worked, so I asked OpenCloud to just make a test transaction and decided to donate a couple bucks to Wikipedia. Besides that, I have no idea what's going to happen. I will report back on the next episode about how it goes. In the meantime, if you want a personal banking solution that can accommodate all the different ways that people use their money, even experimental ones like this one, visit mercury.com/personal. Mercury is a fintech company, not an FDIC insured bank. Banking services provided through Choice Financial Group and column NA members FDIC. You know, she thinks we're getting coffee and walking around the neighborhood. [laughter] Um let me ask you about now um making AI go well. Um it seems like whatever vision we have about how AI goes well has to be compatible with two things. One is the ability to build and run AIs is diffusing extremely rapidly and two is that the population of AIS the amount we have in their intelligence will also increase very rapidly and that means that lots of people will be able to build huge populations of misaligned AIs or uh AIs which are just like companies which are trying to increase their uh footprint or have weird psyches like Sydney Bing but now they're superhuman. What is a vision for a world in which we have an equilibrium that is compatible with lots of different AI some of which are misaligned running around? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I think you know in the adolescence of technology I was kind of you know skeptical of like the balance of power but I I think I was particularly skeptical of or the thing I was specifically skeptical of is you have like three or four of these companies like kind of all building models that are kind of derive you know sort of sort of um uh uh like derived from the like derived from the same thing and uh you know that that these would check each or or even that kind of you know any number of them would would would would uh would would check each other like we might live in a offense dominant world where you know like one person or one AI model is like smart enough to do something that like causes damage for everything else. Um I think in the I mean in the short run we have a limited number of players now. So we can start by within the limited number of players we uh you know we kind of you know we we need to put in place the you know the safeguards. We need to make sure everyone does the right alignment work. we need to make sure everyone has bio classifiers like you know those are those are kind of the immediate things we need to do. I agree that you know that that doesn't solve the problem in the long run particularly if the ability of AI models to make other AI models proliferates then you know the the whole thing can kind of um you know can become harder to solve. You know I think I think in the long run we need some architecture of governance right some some architecture of governance that preserves human freedom but but kind of also allows us to like you know govern the the very large number of kind of um you know uh uh uh human systems AI systems hybrid hybrid human human um you know hybrid hybrid human AI like you know companies or or like or like or like economic units. So, you know, we're we're going to need to think about like, you know, how do we how do we protect the world against, you know, bioteterrorism? How do we protect the world against like, you know, against like against like mirror life? Like, you know, pro probably we're going to need to, you know, need some kind of like AI monitoring system that like moni, you know, kind of monitors for for all these things, but then we need to build this in a way that like, you know, preserves civil liberties and like our constitutional rights. So I think just just as is as is anything else like it's it's like a new security landscape with a new set of you know a new set of tools and a new set of vulnerabilities. And I I think my worry is if we had a hundred years for this to happen all very slowly, we'd get used to it, you know, like we've gotten used to like, you know, the presence of, you know, the presence of explosives in society or like the, you know, the presence of various um, you know, like new weapons or the, you know, the pre the presence of video cameras. Um, we would get used to it over over over over 100 and we'd develop governance mechanisms. We'd make our mistakes. My my worry is just that this is happening all so fast and so I think maybe we need to do our thinking faster about how to make these governance mechanisms work. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like in a offense dominant world over the course of the next century. So the idea is AI is making the progress that would happen over the next century happen in some period of 5 to 10 years. But we would still need the same mechanisms or balance of power would be similarly intractable even if humans were the only game in town. Um, and so I guess we have the advice of AI. We it fundamentally doesn't seem like a totally different ballgame here. If checks and balances were going to work, they would work with humans as well. If they aren't going to work, they wouldn't work with AIS as well. Um, and so maybe this just dooms human checks and balances as well. But yeah, again, I think there's some way to I think there's some way to make this happen. Like it, you know, it just it just, you know, the governments of the world may have to work together to make it happen. like you know we may have to you may have to talk to AIS about kind of you know building societal structures in such a way that like these these defenses are possible. I I I don't know. I mean this is so this is you know I don't want to say so far ahead in time but like so far ahead in technological ability that may happen over a short period of time that it's hard for us to anticipated in advance. Um, speaking of governments getting involved, on December 26th, the Tennessee legislature introduced a bill which uh said, quote, um, it would be an offense for a person to knowingly train artificial intelligence to provide emotional support, including through open-ended conversations with a user. And of course, one of the things that Claude attempts to do is be uh a thoughtful um thoughtful friend, thoughtful, knowledgeable friend. And in general, it seems like we're going to have this patchwork of state laws. A lot of the benefits that normal people could experience as a result of AI are going to be curtailed, especially when we get into the kinds of things you discussed in machines of love and grace, biological freedom, mental health improvements, etc., etc. It seems easier to imagine worlds in which these get whack-a-ole away by different laws. Um, whereas bills like this don't seem to address the actual existential threats that you're concerned about. So I'm curious about to understand in the context of things like this your anthropics position against the federal moratorium on state AI laws. &gt;&gt; Yes. So I don't know there's there's many different things going on at once, right? I think I think that that I think that particular law is is dumb. Like you know I think it was it was clearly made by legislators who just probably had little idea what AI models could do and not do. They're like AI models serving as that just sounds scary. Like I don't want I don't want that to happen. So, you know, we're we're we're not we're not in favor of that, right? But but but that, you know, that that wasn't the thing that was being voted on. The thing that was being voted on is we're going to ban all state regulation of AI for 10 years with no apparent plan to to do any federal regulation of AI, which would take Congress to pass, which is a very high bar. Um so you know the idea that we'd ban states from doing anything for 10 years and people said they had a plan for federal government but you know there was no actual there was no proposal on the table. There was no actual attempt. Um given the serious dangers that I lay out in adolescence of technology around things like the you know kind of biological weapons and bioteterrorism autonomy risk and the timelines we've been talking about like 10 years is an eternity. like that's that's a that's a I I think that's a crazy thing to do. So if if that's the choice, if that's what you force us to choose, then then we're going to we're going to choose not to have that moratorum. And you know, I think the the the benefits of that position exceed the costs. But it's it's not a perfect position if that's the choice. Now, I think the thing that we should do, the thing that I would support is the federal government should step in, not saying states you can't regulate, but here's what we're going to do and and states you can't differ from this, right? Like I think preeemption is fine in the sense of saying that federal government says here's our standard. This applies to everyone. States can't do something different. That would be something I would support if it would be done in the right way. What um but but this idea of states you can't do anything and we're not doing anything either that that struck that struck us as you know very much not making sense and I think will not age well it's already starting to not age well with with all the um backlash that that you've seen now in terms of in terms of what we would want I mean you know the things we've talked about are are starting with transparency standards um uh uh you know in order to monitor some of these autonomy risks and bio terrorism risks as the risks become more serious um as we as we get more evidence for them then I think we could be more aggressive in some targeted ways and and say hey AI bioteterrorism is really a threat let's let's pass a law that kind of forces people to have classifiers and I could even imagine it it depends it depends how serious a threat it ends up being we don't know for sure and we need to pursue this in an intellectually honest way where we say ahead of time the risk has not emerged yet but I could certainly imagine with the pace that things are going that you know I could imagine a world where later this year we say hey this this AI bioteterrorism stuff is really serious we should do something about it we should put it in a federal we should you know put it in a federal standard and if the federal government won't act we should put it in a state standard I could totally see that I I I'm concerned about a world where if you just consider the the pace of progress you're expecting the life cycle of of legislation you the the benefits are, as you say, because of diffusion lag, the benefits are slow enough that I really do think this patchwork of on the current trajectory, this patchwork of state laws would prohibit. I mean, having an emotional chatbot friend is something that freaks people out, then just imagine the kinds of actual benefits from AI we want normal people to be able to experience from improvements in health and health span and improvements in mental health and so forth. whereas at the same time uh it seems like you think the dangers are already on the horizon and I just don't see that much um it seems like would be especially injurious to the benefits of AI uh as compared to the the dangers of AI and so that that's maybe the where the cost benefit makes less sense to me. So, so, so there's a few things here, right? I mean, people talk about there being thousands of these state laws. First of all, the vast vast majority of them do not pass. Um, and you know, the the the the you know, the world works a certain way in theory, but like just because a law has been passed doesn't mean it's really enforced, right? The people the people you know implementing it may be like, "Oh my god, this is stupid." It would mean shutting off like, you know, everything that's ever been built and everything that's ever been built in Tennessee. So, you know, very often laws are interpreted in like, you know, a way that makes them that that that makes them not as dangerous or not as harmful. On on the same side, of course, you have to worry if you're passing a law to stop a bad thing, you had this you had this problem as well. Yeah. Um uh look my my look I mean my basic view is you know if if if you know we could decide you know what laws were passed and how things were done which you know we're only one small input input into that you know I would deregulate a lot of the stuff around the health benefits of AI. Um I think you know I I don't worry as much about the like the the the kind of chatbot laws. I I actually worry more about the drug approval process where I think AI models are going to greatly accelerate um the rate at which we discover drugs and just the the pipeline will get jammed up like the pipeline will not be prepared to like process all all of the stuff that's going through it. So um you know I I I think I think reform of the regulatory process to buy us more towards we have a lot of things coming where the safety and the efficacy is actually going to be really crisp and clear like I mean a beautiful thing really really crisp and clear and like really really effective but you know and and and maybe we don't need all this all this um uh uh like um all this superructure around it that was designed around an era of drugs that barely work and often and have serious side effects. Um but at the same time I think we should be ramping up quite significantly the um uh you know this this kind of safety and security legislation and you know like I've said um you know starting with transparency is is my view of trying not to hamper the industry right trying to find the right balance. I'm worried about it. Some people criticize my essay for saying that's too slow. The dangers of AI will come too soon if we do that. Well, basically I kind of think like the last 6 months and maybe the next few months are going to be about transparency. And then if these ris if these risks emerge when we're more certain of them, which I think we might be as soon as as later this year, then I think we need to act very fast in the areas that we've actually seen the risk. Like I think the only way to do this is to be nimble. Now the legislative process is normally not nimble but we we need to emphasize to everyone involved the urgency of this. That's why I'm sending this message of urgency, right? That's why I wrote adolescence of technology. I wanted policy makers to read it. I wanted economists to read it. I want national security professionals to read it. You know, I want decision makers to read it so that they have some hope of acting faster than they would have otherwise. Is there anything you can do or advocate that would make it more certain that the benefits of AI are um are better instantiated where I feel like you have worked with legislators to be like okay we're going to prevent biotterism here way we're going to increase we're going to increase whistleblower protection and I just think by default the actual ben like the things we're looking forward to here it just seems very easy they seem very fragile to uh different kinds of moral panics or political economy problems. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't actually so so I don't actually agree that much in the developed world. I feel like, you know, in the developed world like markets function pretty well and when there's when there's like a lot of money to be made on something and it's clearly the best available alternative, it's actually hard for the regulatory system to stop it. You know, we're we're seeing that in AI itself, right? I you know, like a thing I've been trying to fight for is export controls on chips to China, right? And like that's in the national security interests of the US like you know that's like square within the you know the the policy beliefs of you know every almost everyone in Congress of both parties but and you know I think the case is very clear. The counterarguments against it are I'll politely call them fishy. Um uh and yet it doesn't happen and we sell the chips because there's there's so much money there's so much money riding on it. um and you know the the that money wants to be made and and in that case in my opinion that's a bad thing. Um and but but it also it also applies when when it's a good thing and and so I I don't think that if we're talking about drugs and benefits of the technology I I I I am not as worried about those benefits being hampered in the developed world. I am a little worried about them going too slow and I as I said I do think we should work to speed the approval process in the FDA. I do think we should fight against these chatbot bills that you're describing right described individually. I'm against them. I think they're stupid. Um but I actually think the bigger worry is a developing world um where we don't have functioning markets where um you know we often can't build on the technology that that we've had. I worry more that those folks will get left behind. And I worry that even if the cures are developed, you know, maybe there's someone in rural Mississippi who who doesn't get it as well. Right? That's a that's a that's a kind of smaller version of the thing the concern we have in the in the developing world. And so the things we've been doing are you know you know we work with you know we work with you know philanthropists right you know we work with folks um who you know who you know deliver you know medicine and health interventions to you know to to developing world to subsaharan Africa you know India Latin America you know you know other other developing parts of the world that's the thing I think that won't happen on its own you mentioned export controls Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why can't US and China both have a country of geniuses &gt;&gt; on a data center? &gt;&gt; Why can't you know why won't it happen or why should &gt;&gt; why shouldn't it happen? &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't it happen? Um, you know, I think I think if this does happen, um, you know, then then we kind of have a well, we could have a few situ if we have like an offense dominant situation. We could have a situation like nuclear weapons, but like more dangerous, right? Where it's like um, you know, kind of kind of either side could could easily destroy everything. Um, we could also have a world where it's kind of it's unstable. Like the nuclear equilibrium is stable, right? Because it's, you know, it's like deterrence. But let's say there were uncertainty about like if the two AIs fought, which AI would win. Um, that could create instability, right? You often have conflict when the two sides have a different assessment of their likelihood of winning, right? If one side is like, oh yeah, there's a 90% chance I'll win. And the other side's like, there's a 90% chance I'll win, then then a fight is much more likely. Um, they can't both be right, but they can both think that. But this seems like a fully general argument against the diffusion of AI technology which it may which is that's the implication of this world. &gt;&gt; Let me let me just go on because I think we will get diffusion eventually. The other concern I have is that people the governments will oppress their own people with AI and and and so um you know I'm I'm just I'm worried about some world where you have a country that's already you know kind of a uh you know you know there's there's a government that kind of kind of already um you know is is kind of kind of building a you know a tech high-tech authoritarian state. Um and to be clear this is about the government. this is not about the people like people we need to find a way for people everywhere to benefit. Um my worry here is about governments. Um so yeah my you know my my worry is the world gets carved up into two pieces one of those two pieces could be authoritarian or totalitarian in a way that's very difficult to displace. Um now will will governments eventually get powerful AI and and you know there's risk of authoritarianism? Yes. Will governments eventually get powerful AI and there's risk of um uh you know of of kind of bad bad bad equilibria? Yes, I think both things, but the initial conditions matter, right? You know, at at some point we're need we're going to need to set up the rules of the road. I'm not saying that one country, either the United States or a coalition of democracies, which I think is would be a better setup, although it requires more international cooperation than we currently seem to want to make. Um, but you know, I don't I don't think a coalition of democracies or or certainly one country should just say these are the rules of the road. There's going to be some negotiation, right? The world is going to have to grapple with this. And what I would like is that the the the democratic nations of the world, those with, you know, who are clo whose governments have represent closer to prohuman values are are holding a stronger hand then have have more leverage when the rules of the road are set. And and so I'm I'm very concerned about that initial condition. I um I was relisting to an interview from three years ago and one of the ways it aged poorly is that I kept asking questions assuming there's going to be some key fulcrum moment two to three years from now when in fact being that far out it just seems like progress continues AI improves AI is more diffused and people will use it for more things. It seems like you're imagining a world in the future where the countries get together and here's the rules of the road and here's the leverage we have, here's the leverage you have when it seems like on current trajectory, everybody will have more AI. Um, some of that AI will be used by authoritarian countries. Some of that within the authoritarian countries will be by private actors versus state actors. It's not clear who will benefit more. It's always unpredictable to tell tell in advance. You know, it seems like the internet privileged authoritarian countries more than you would have expected. Um, and maybe the AI will be the opposite way around. Um so I I I want to better understand what you're imagining here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So so just to be precise about it, I think the exponential of the underlying technology will continue as it has before, right? The models get smarter and smarter even when they get to country of geniuses in a data center. You know, I I think you can continue to make the model smarter. There's a question of like getting diminishing returns on their value in the world, right? How much does it matter after you've already solved human biology or you know you know at some point you can do harder math you can do more abstuse math problems but nothing after that matters but putting that aside I do think the the exponential will continue but there will be certain distinguished points on the exponential and companies individuals countries will reach those points at different times um and and so you know there's there's you know could there be some you know you know I talk about is a nuclear deterrent still in adolescence of technology is a nuclear deterrent still stable uh in the world of of of AI I don't know but that's that's an example of like one thing we've taken for granted that like the technology could reach such a level that it's no longer like you know we can no longer be certain of it at least um uh you know think of think of others you know there there you know there there are kind of points where if you if you reach a certain point you maybe you have offensive cyber dominance and like every every computer system is transparent to you after that. Um, unless the other side has a has a kind of equivalent defense. So, I don't know what the critical moment is or if there's a single critical moment. But I think there will be either a critical moment, a small number of critical moments or some critical window where it's like AI is AI confers some large advantage from the perspective of national security and one country or coalition has reached it before others that that you know that that that you know I'm not advocating that they're just like okay we're in charge now. That's not that's not how that's not how I think about it. you know that there's always the the other side is catching up. There's extreme actions you're not willing to take and and and it's not right to take, you know, to take complete um to take complete control anyway. But but at at the point that that happens, I think people are going to understand that the world has changed. And there there's going to be some negotiation, implicit or implicit, about what what is the what is the post AI world order look like? And and I think my interest is in, you know, making that ne negotiation be one in which, you know, classical liberal democracy has, you know, has a strong hand. Well, I want to understand what that better means because you say in the essay, quote, autocracy is simply not a form of government that people can accept in the post powerful AI. And that sounds like you're saying the CCP as an institution cannot exist after we get AGI. Um, and that seems like a like a very strong demand and it seems to imply a world where the leading lab or the leading country will be able to and by that language should get to determine how the world is governed or what kinds of governments are allowed and not allowed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when I when I um I I believe that paragraph was I think I said something like you could take it even further and say X. So I wasn't I wasn't necessarily endorsing that that that I wasn't necessarily endorsing that view. I you know I was saying like here's if first you know here here's a weaker thing that I believe you know I think I you know I think I said you know we have to worry a lot about authoritarians and you know we should try and you know kind of kind of check them and limit their power. Like you could take this kind of further much more interventionist view that says like authoritarian countries with AI are these you know the the you know the these kind of self-fulfilling cycles that that you can't that are very hard to displace and so you just need to get rid of them from from the beginning that that has exactly all the problems you say which is you know you know if you were to make a commitment to overthrowing every authoritarian country I mean they then they would take a bunch of actions now that like you know that that that could could lead to instability so that that may or you know that that just that just may not be possible. But the point I was making that I do endorse is that it is it is quite possible that you know today you know the view or at least my view or the view in most the western world is is democracy is a better form of government than authoritarianism. But it's not like if a country is authoritarian, we don't react the way we reacted if they committed a genocide or something, right? And and I'm I guess what I'm saying is I'm a little worried that in the age of AGI, authoritarianism will have a different meaning. It will be a graver thing. Um and and we have to decide one way or another how to h how to deal with that. And the interventionist view is one possible view. I was exploring such views. um you know it may end up being the right view. It it may end up being too extreme to be the right view. But I do have hope and one piece of hope I have is there there is we have seen that as new technologies are invented forms of government become obsolete. I I mentioned this in adolescence of technology where I said you know like feudalism was basically you know like a form of government right and and then when when we invented industrialization feudalism was no longer sustainable it no longer made sense why is that hope couldn't that imply that democracy is no longer going to be a competitive system &gt;&gt; it it could right it could go it could go either way right but but I actually so I these problems with authoritarianism, right? That the problems with authoritarianism get deeper. I just I wonder if that's an indicator of other problems that authoritarianism will have, right? In other words, people become because authoritarianism becomes worse, people are more afraid of authoritarianism. They work harder to stop it. It's it's more of a like you have to think in terms of total equilibrium, right? Um, I just wonder if it will motivate new ways of thinking about with the with with the new technology how to preserve and protect freedom &gt;&gt; and and even more optimistically, will it lead to a collective reckoning and, you know, a kind of a a more emphatic realization of how important some of the things we take as individual rights are, right? a more emphatic realization that we just we really can't give these away. There's there we've seen there's no other way to live that actually works. Um I I I I am actually I am actually hopeful that I I guess one way to say it it sounds too idealistic but I actually believe it could be the case is is that is that dictatorships become morally obsolete. They become morally unworkable forms of government. Um and that and that and that the the the the crisis that that creates is is is sufficient to force us to find another way. Um I I think there is genuinely a tough question here which I'm not sure how you resolve for and we've had to come out one way or another on it through history right so with China in the 70s and ' 80s we decided even though it's an authoritarian system we will engage with it and I think in retrospect that was the right call because it has stayed authoritarian system but a billion plus people are much wealthier and better off than they would have otherwise been um and it's not clear that it would have stopped being an authoritarian country otherwise you can just look at North Korea uh as an example of that, right? And I don't know if that takes that much that much intelligence to remain an authoritarian country that continues to coales its own power. And so you can just imagine a North Korea with an AI that's much worse than everybody else's but still enough to keep power and and and and then so in general it seems like should we just have this attitude of the benefits of AI will in the form of all these empowerments of humanity and health and so forth will be big and in historically we have decided it's good to spread the benefits of technology widely even with even to people whose governments are authoritarian and I think I guess it is a tough question how to think about it with AI but um historically we have said Yes, this there this is a positive some world and it's still worth diffusing technology. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So so there are a number of choices we have. I you know I think framing this as a kind of government to government decision and and you know in in national security terms that's like one lens but there are a lot of other lenses like you could imagine a world where you know we produce all these cures to diseases and like the you know the the the cures to diseases are fine to sell to authoritarian countries. The data centers just aren't right. the chips and the data centers just aren't um and that the AI industry itself. Um uh you know like like another possibility is and and I think folks should think about this like you know could there be developments we can make either that naturally happen as a result of AI or that we could make happen by building technology on AI. Could we create an equilibrium where where it becomes infeasible for authoritarian countries to deny their people kind of private use of the benefits of the technology? Um uh you know are there are there are there are there equilibria where we can kind of give everyone in authoritarian country their own AI model that kind of you you know like defends themselves from surveillance and there isn't a way for the authoritarian country to like crack crack down on this while while retaining power. I don't know that that sounds to me like if that went far enough it would be it would be a reason why authoritarian countries would disintegrate from the inside. Um but but maybe there's a middle world where like there there's an equilibrium where if they want to hold on to power the authoritarians can't deny kind of individualized access access to the technology. But I actually do have a hope for the for the um for the for the more radical version which is you know is it possible that the technology might inherently have properties or that by building on it in certain ways we could create properties um that that that that have this kind of dissolving effect on authoritarian structures. Now, we we hoped originally, if we think back to the beginning of the Obama administration, we thought originally that that, you know, social media and and the internet would have that property, and it turns out not to. But, but I I don't know what what if we could uh what if we could try again with with the knowledge of how many things could go wrong and that this is a different technology. I don't know that it would work, but it's worth a try. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it's just it's very unpredictable. Like there's first principles reasons why authoritarianism. &gt;&gt; It's all very unpredictable. I I don't think I mean we got to we we just got to we kind of we got to recognize the problem and then we got to come up with 10 things we can try and we got to try those and then assess whether they're working or which ones are working if any and and then try new ones if the old ones aren't. I guess what that nets out to today is you say we will not sell data centers or sorry chips and then the ability to make chips to China and so in some sense you are denying there would be some benefits to that's right the Chinese economy Chinese people etc because we're doing that and then there'd also be benefits to the American economy because it's a positive sum world we could trade they could have their country data centers doing one thing we could have ours doing another and already we you're saying it's not worth that positive sum stipend to empower this country's &gt;&gt; what what I would say is that you know we are we are about to be in a world where growth and economic value will come very easily if right if we're able to build these powerful AI models growth and economic value will come very easily what will not come easily is distribution of benefits distribution of wealth political freedom um you know these are the things that are going to be hard to achieve and so when I think about policy I think I think that the technology and the market will deliver all the fundamental benefits, you know, almost almost faster than we can take them. Um uh and and that these questions about about distribution and political freedom and rights are are are the ones that that will actually matter and that policy should focus on. Okay. So speaking of distribution, as you're mentioning, we have developing countries and &gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; in many cases catchup growth has weak been weaker than we would have hoped for. When catchup growth does happen, it's fundamentally because they have underutilized labor and we can bring the capital and knowhow from developed countries to these countries and then they can grow quite rapidly. &gt;&gt; Obviously in a world where labor is no longer the constraining factor, this mechanism no longer works. &gt;&gt; And so is the hope basically to rely on philanthropy from the people who immediately get wealthy from AI or from the countries that get wealthy from AI? What what is the hope for? Yeah, I I mean philanthropy should obviously play some role as it has the you know as has in the past but I think growth is always growth is always better and stronger if we can make it endogenous. So you know what are the relevant industries in like in like in like in like an AI driven world. Look there's lots of stuff you know like there's you know I said I said we shouldn't build data centers in China but there's no reason we shouldn't build data centers in Africa right? Um in fact I think it'd be great to build data centers in Africa. um you know as not long as they're not owned by China. We should we should build we should build data centers in Africa. I think that's a that's that's I think that's a great thing to do. um you know we should also build you know there's no reason we can't build you know a pharmaceutical industry that's like AIdriven like you know the the if if AI is accelerating accelerating drug discovery then you know there will be a bunch of biotech startups like let's make sure some of those happen in the developing world and certainly during the transition I mean we can talk about the point where humans have no role but but humans will have still have some role in starting up these companies and supervising supervising the AI models so let's make sure some of those humans are humans in developing world so that fast growth can happen there as well. &gt;&gt; You guys recently announced quad is going to have a constitution that's aligned to a set of values and not necessarily just the end user and there's a world you can imagine where if it is aligned to the end user it preserves the balance of power we have in the world today because everybody gets to have their own AI that's advocating for them and so the ratio of bad actors to good actors stays constant. It seems to work out for our world today. Um why is it better not to do that but to have a specific set of values that the AI should carry forward? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah so I'm not sure I'd quite draw the distinction in that way. Um there there are maybe two relevant distinctions here which are I think you're talking about a mix of the two like one is should we give the model a set of instructions about do this and versus don't do this &gt;&gt; and the other you know versus should we give the model a set of principles for you know for kind of how to act. Um and and and there it's it's you know it's I you know it's it's just p it's kind of purely a practical and empirical thing that we've observed that by teaching the model principles getting it to learn from principles its behavior is more consistent. It's easier to cover edge cases and the model is more likely to do what people want it to do. In other words, if you, you know, if you're like, you know, don't tell people how to hotwire a car, don't speak in Korea, and don't, you know, you know, just, you know, if you give it a list of rules, it doesn't really understand the rules, and it's kind of hard to generalize from them. Um, you know, if if it's just kind of a like, you know, list of do dos and don'ts. Whereas, if you give it principles and then, you know, it has some hard guard rails like don't make biological weapons. But overall you're trying to understand what it should be aiming to do h how it should be aiming to operate. So just from a practical perspective that turns out to be just a more effective way to train the model. That's one piece of it. So that you know it's the kind of rules versus principles trade-off. Then there's another thing you're talking about which is kind of like the cageability versus um like you know I would say kind of intr intrinsic motivation trade-off which is like how much should the model be a kind of I don't know like a a skin suit or something where you know you know you know you just kind of you know it just kind of directly follows the instructions that are given to it by whoever is giving it those instructions. um versus how much should the model have an inherent set of values and and go off and do things on its own. Um and and and and and there I I would actually say everything about the model is actually closer to the direction of of like you know it should mostly do what people want. It should mostly follow the we're not trying to build something that like you know goes off and runs the world on its own. We're actually pretty far on the corable side. Now, now what we do say is there are certain things that the model won't do, right? That it's like you know that that that I think we say it in various ways in the constitution that under normal circumstances if someone asks the model to do a task it should do that task that that should be the default. Um but if you've asked it [snorts] to do something dangerous or if you've you know if you've um asked it to um you know uh uh uh to kind of harm someone else um then the model is unwilling to do that. So I I actually think of it as like a mostly a mostly corable model that has some limits but those limits are based on principles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean then the fundamental question is how are those principles determined? And this is not a special question for anthropic. would be a question for any company but um &gt;&gt; uh because you have been the ones to actually write down the principles I get to ask you this question normally a constitution is like you write it down it's set in stone and there's a process of updating it and changing it and so forth in this case it seems like a document that people anthropic write that can be changed at any time that guides the behavior of systems are going to be the basis of a lot of economic activity what is H how do you think about ho how those principles should be set? &gt;&gt; Yes. Um so I think there's there's two there's maybe three three kind of sizes of loop here, right? Three three ways to iterate. One is you can iterate. We iterate within enthropic. We train the model. We're not happy with it and we kind of change the constitution. &gt;&gt; And I think that's good to do. Um and you know putting out publicly you know making updates to the constitution every once in a while saying here's a new constitution. I think that's good to do because people can comment on it. The second level of loop is different companies will have different constitutions. Um and you know I think it's useful for like anthropic puts out a constitution and you know you the Gemini model puts out a constitution and you know other companies put out a constitution and then then they can kind of look at them compare outside observers can critique and say this this I like this one this thing from this constitution and this thing for that constitution and and then kind of that that creates some kind of you know soft incentive and feedback for all the companies to like take the best of each elements and improve Then I think there's a third loop which is you know society beyond the AI companies and beyond just those who kind of you know who who comment on the constitutions without hard power and and there you know we've done some experiments like you know a couple years ago we did an experiment with I think it was called the collective intelligence project to like um you know to to basically pull people and ask them what should be in our AI constitution. um uh and and you know I think at the time we incorporated some of those changes and so you could imagine with the new approach we've taken to the constitution doing something like that it's a little harder because it's like that was actually an easier approach to take when the constitution was like a list of dos and don'ts um at the level of principles it has to have a certain amount of coherence um but but you could you could still imagine getting views from a wide variety of people and I think you could also imagine and this is like a crazy idea but hey you know this whole interview is about crazy ideas, right? So, um uh you know, you could even imagine systems of of kind of representative government having having input, right? Like, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't do this today because the legislative process is so slow. Like this is exactly why I think we should be careful about the legislative process and AI regulation. But there's no reason you couldn't in principle say like you know all AI you know all AI models have to have a constitution that starts with like these things and then like you can append you can append other things after it but like there has to be this special section that like takes precedence. I wouldn't do that. That's too rigid. That that sounds um you know that that that that sounds kind of overly prescriptive in a way that I think overly aggressive legislation is. But like that is a thing you could you know like like that is that is a thing you could try to do. Is is there some much less heavy-handed version of that? Maybe I really like control loop too. um where obviously this is not how constitutions of actual governments do or should work where there there's not this vague sense in which the Supreme Court will feel out how people are feeling and what are their vibes and then update the of the constitution accordingly. There's with actual governments there's a more procedural process. Exactly. But you actually have a vision &gt;&gt; of competition between constitutions which is actually very reminiscent of how um &gt;&gt; some libertarian charter cities people used to talk about what an archipelago of different kinds of governments could look like and then there would be selection among them of who could operate the most effectively in which place people would be the happiest. And in a sense you're actually yeah there's this vision. I'm I'm kind of recreating that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. This utopia of archipelago, &gt;&gt; you know, again, you know, I think I think that vision has has, you know, things to recommend it and things that things things that will kind of kind of go wrong with it. You know, I think I think it's a I think it's an interesting in some ways compelling vision, but also things will go wrong with it that you hadn't that you hadn't imagined. So, you know, I I I like loop 2 as well, but I I I feel like the whole thing has got to be some some mix of loops one, two, and three. And it's it's a matter of the proportions, right? I I think that's got to be the the answer. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; when somebody eventually writes the equivalent of the making of the atomic bomb for this era, what is the thing that will be hardest to glean from the historical record that they're most likely to miss? I think a few things. One is at every moment of this exponential, the extent to which the world outside it didn't understand it. This is this is a bias that's often present in history where anything that actually happened looks inevitable in retrospect and and so you know I I think when people when people look back it will be hard for them to put themselves in the place of people who were actually making a bet on this thing to happen that wasn't inevitable that we had these arguments like the arguments you know that I make for scaling or that continual learning will be solved um uh uh you know that that you know some of us internally in our heads put a high probability on this happening but but it's like there's there's a world outside us that's not that's not acting on it's not kind of not acting on that at all. Um uh and and and I think I think the the weirdness of it um I I I I think unfortunately like the insolerity of it like you know if if we're one year or two years away from it happening like the average person on the street has no idea and that's one of the things I'm trying to change like with the memos with talking to policy makers but like I don't know I think I I I think that's just a that's just like a crazy that's just like a crazy thing. Yeah. Um, finally I would say and and this probably applies to almost all historical moments of crisis. Um, how absolutely fast it was happening, how everything was happening all at once. And so decisions that you might think, you know, were kind of carefully calculated, well, actually you have to make that decision and then you have to make 30 other decisions on the on the same day because it's all happening so fast and and you don't even know which decisions are going to turn out to be consequential. So, you know, one of my one of my I guess worries, although it's also an insight into into, you know, into kind of what's happening is that, you know, some very critical decision will be will be some decision that, you know, someone just comes into my office and is like, Dario, you have two minutes like, you know, should we should we do, you know, should we do thing thing A or thing B on this like, you know, someone gives me this random, you know, half page half page memo and is like, should we should we do A or B? And I'm like, I don't know. I have to eat lunch. Let's do B. And and you know, that ends up being the most consequential thing ever. &gt;&gt; So, final question. Uh, it seems like you have there's not tech CEOs who are usually writing 50page memos every few months, and it seems like you have managed to build a role for yourself and a company around you which is compatible with this more intellectual type role of CEO. And I want to understand how you construct that and how like how does that work to be you just go away for a couple weeks and then you tell your company this is the memo like here's what we're doing. It's also reported you write a bunch of these internally. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I mean for this particular one you know I wrote it over winter break. Um uh so it was the time you know and I was having a a hard time finding the time to actually find it to actually write it. But I actually think about this in a broader way. Um I actually think it relates to the culture of the company. So I probably spend a third maybe 40% of my time making sure the culture of Enthropic is good. As Enthropic has gotten larger, it's it's gotten harder to just, you know, get involved in like, you know, directly involved in like the training of the models, the launch of the models, the building of the products. Like it's 2500 people. It's like, you know, there's just, you know, I have certain instincts, but like there's only, you know, I it's very difficult to get to get to get involved in every single detail. You know, I like I I try as much as possible, but one thing that's very leveraged is making sure Anthropic is a good place to work. People like working there. Everyone thinks of themselves as team members. Everyone works together instead of against each other. And you know, we've seen as some of the other AI companies have grown without naming any names, you know, we're starting to see decoherence and people fighting each other. And you know, I would argue there was even a lot of that from the beginning, but but you know, that it's it's gotten worse. But I I think we've done an extraordinarily good job, even if not perfect, of holding the company together, making everyone feel the mission, that we're sincere about the mission, and that, you know, everyone has faith that everyone else there is working for the right reason, that we're a team, that people aren't trying to get ahead at each other's expense or backstab each other, which again, I think happens a lot at some of the other places. Um, and and how do you make that the case? I mean it's a lot of things you know it's me it's it's it's Daniela who you know runs the company dayto-day it's the co-founders it's the other people we hire it's the environment we try to create but I think an important thing in the culture is I some and you know the the you know the other leaders as well but especially me have to articulate what the company is about why it's doing what it's doing what its strategy is what its values are what its mission is and what it stands for And um you know when you get to 2500 people you can't do that person by person. You have to write or you have to speak to the whole company. This is why I get up in front of the whole company every two weeks and speak for an hour. It's actually I mean I wouldn't say I write essays internally. I do two things. One I write this thing called DVQ Dario Vision Quest. Um uh uh I wasn't the one who named it that. That's the name it it it received and it's one of these names that I kind of I tried to fight it because it made it sound like I was like going off and smoking peyote or something. Um uh but but the name just stuck. Um so I get up in front of the company every two weeks. I have like a three or four page document and I just kind of talk through like three or four different topics about what's going on internally the you know the the models we're producing the products the outside industry the world as a whole as it relates to AI and geopolitically in general you know just some mix of that and I just go through very very honestly I just go through and I just I just say you know this is this is what I'm thinking this is what anthropic leadership is thinking and then I answer questions and and that direct connection I think has a lot of value that is hard to achieve when you're passing things down the chain you know six six levels deep um uh and you know large fraction of the company comes comes to attend either either in person or um either in person or virtually and you know it really means that you can communicate a lot and then the other thing I do is I just you know I have a channel in Slack where I just write a bunch of things and comment a lot um and often that's in response to you know just things I'm seeing at the company or questions people ask or like you know we do internal surveys and there are things people are concerned about and so I'll write them up and I'm like I'm you know I'm I'm I'm just I'm very honest about these things you know I just I just say them very directly and the point is to get a reputation of telling the company the truth about what's happening to call things what they are to acknowledge problems to avoid the sort of corpo speak the kind of defensive communication that often is necessary in public because you know the world is very large and full of people who are you know interpreting things in bad faith. Um but you know if you have a company of people who you trust and we try to hire people that we trust then then you know you can you can you can you know you can you can really just be entirely unfiltered. Um and uh you know I think I think that's an enormous strength of the company. It makes it a better place to work. It makes people more you know more the sum of their parts and increases likelihood that we accomplish the mission because everyone is on the same page about the mission and everyone is debating and discussing how best to accomplish the mission. &gt;&gt; Well in lie of an external Dario vision quest we have this interview. &gt;&gt; This this interview is a little like that. &gt;&gt; Uh this is fun Dario.
