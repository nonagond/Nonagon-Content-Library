Kind: captions Language: en I recently spoke with someone who's a longtime investor, actually loves Bitcoin. Yeah. But said they sold all of their Bitcoin in the 90,000 range because they're anticipating this massive crash cuz we're going to go over a cliff and oh, he'll buy back in when it's like 70K or something. And I'm like, I don't know. Good luck with that. I mean, we could always crash, right? I think we get a little excited when we hit a new alltime high. But we've seen some aggressive pullbacks with Bitcoin. Um yet, I don't know. It feels like it's going to be less volatile and the downturns are not going to be 80% pullback like it used to be. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What I would say to that first of all is actually you gave me this word on an interview we did together, the fiat maxi. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, when I was in Puerto Rico in 2021, one of my good friends there was a a really well-known hedge fund manager and he makes a lot of money. Super super smart. And uh he doesn't believe in Bitcoin and no matter how many nights we had dinner together, I just couldn't get him to believe in it. U but he loves Bitcoin to trade it. He loves to trade it and he'll buy it at 20 and sell it at 50 and then he'll buy it at 60 and sell it at 80 and he loves it and he's made a lot of money with it. But he's willing to buy it at 40 and sell it for 65 and then buy it again at 70 and sell it at 90 because he's not trying to get more Bitcoin. He's trying to make more dollars. &gt;&gt; But I want to get more Bitcoin. And so that strategy that he's doing doesn't get you more of it. So, like this guy that you're referencing, uh, this trader, I mean, certainly he can sell it at 90, but he'll probably buy back in higher than he sold it for. And if he's just trying to get more dollars, that that will work, right? Um, I don't think that's going to work for us. Now, back to the draw downs. So, there's a couple things. Number one, since the ETFs have come out, the volatility on Bitcoin has completely collapsed. &gt;&gt; So, I've been dealing with this firsthand. I've been working with some treasury companies, and there's a lot of Bitcoin sitting there. And so a lot of people are trying to figure out how to monetize that Bitcoin. And we've met with some of the top trading firms around the world that can trade, you know, roll options on Bitcoin or whatever you can do to uh generate yield. And the numbers that they're showing year to date are not good, right? So the volatility is completely compressed. I think so. Number one, I think that big draw down that a lot of people are expecting is probably not going to happen. And I think another reason why I would also say that is well, there's I think there's two really good other reasons. So number one, if you look at Bitcoin, if you believe the four-year having cycle um story of that we have the supply shock every four years, right? Right now you have ETFs and treasury companies buying about 10 times more Bitcoin than the new supply that's being created. So there's a massive supply demand imbalance there. The demand has been has been being met by OG whales unlocking giant wallets, but it's not about the new supply. And so if you cut the supply in half from here, it's really inconsequential to the demand that's there. &gt;&gt; You recently did a video that I found really interesting. I think it went viral about what the Russian uh advisor said and the crypto cloud that we're trying to push all of our debt into to essentially do a reset. I wanted to get more of your take on that because we're seeing some massive geopolitical shifts on the monetary level happen. Um more net settlement in gold. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And yet we are pushing stable coins more and more. We had the Genius Act. Now they're working on the Clarity Act. So what do you think the strategy is? Because we have not created I mean we've established the strategic Bitcoin reserve but there's no audit of how much Bitcoin we have and no official plan of how we're going to accumulate more yet. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they're they're pushing into these stable coins and I think they're going to want those to be uh buyers for short-term treasuries, right? Since we no longer have as much foreign demand. So what do you think are the chess pieces at play here? Because it seems like bricks is moving to gold. Are we going to move to gold or are we going to move to Bitcoin? &gt;&gt; So over what time frame? And that's always the question to ask. So you're going to hear for the audience, you'll hear like this guy says bonds are terrible. This guy says bonds are great. &gt;&gt; And typically there's a mismatch on time frame. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um there's a big mismatch on time frame on Bitcoin, on Bitcoin treasury companies like Micro Strategy. like Sailor always talks in 10 year or 20 year time frames, but then you have option traders trying to trade it quarterly, right? So, back to this question. So, I think there's several of things going on. Number one, um the Biden administration and Anthony Blinken killed the dollar when they basically seized Russia's bank accounts, right, during the invasion of Ukraine. But really, it started way before that. So, in 2013, Russia and China had announced ddollarization efforts. So, it had been it had been going on for a long time. So, the world's been trying to move away from the dollar for a really long time. And mostly because well two reasons. Number one, the US continues to print more dollars. Um and so if you're holding the bond, you're just getting liquidated. Number two, um the weaponization of the US dollar. And so that really culminated with that, you know, with when Russia took in moved into Ukraine and the US and NATO basically seized their bank accounts. Three superpowers in the world with nuclear weapons, one of which was Russia. And so all the nations of the world thought, shoot, if it happens to them, what what what you know, what chance do we have? Okay. So, we'll come back to that in a second, but um there's two other things. So, then the dollar, there's the dollar's reserve status in the world and that's being threatened because nations don't want to hold it. And so, there's been a move to gold. So, the bricks have been moving to gold, China's been moving to gold. Russia's been moving to gold, right? Uh we can see the central banks around the world have been buying, they're net buyers of gold. &gt;&gt; But then we have the US dollar. And so, I think it's a interesting move. I think it's a genius move of what the Trump administration is doing. So, they've passed uh many executive orders this year, one of which is the Genius Act, right? And so, using the dollar, I did a video talking about, you mentioned the chessboard. I the cliche term of the 40 chess move, but I talked about the 40 chess game that Trump is playing in the Mara Lago Accords, and there was a a few key things that Trump wanted to achieve. One of which was keeping the US dollar at 60% of global um FX of global exchange. and it had dipped down to about 59%. So, right 60% is where he wants it to be. And so, one of the ways that they can do that is by putting stable coins out across the world. And so, there's a couple ways that uh reasons why we want to do that. Number one, he wants to keep it at about 60% of global trade. So, we need people to continue to use that. &gt;&gt; The people around the world, not the governments, but the people are dying for the dollar. And that's because, I should say, dying to get in, dying to use the dollar. They want to exchange their failing currencies. So we have currencies collapsing all around the world experiencing really high double-digit inflation. You know, Lebanon, Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, etc. And so those pe people need to get out of the currency that they're in. And so they want to get into the dollar, but the nations put capital control laws in. So they can't really get out into the dollar. And so the stable coins allow them to do that very easily, right? So that's number one. Number two, what the Trump administration did through the Genius Act is then make the stable coin issuers buy US treasuries. So now you have this demand for US treasuries, which is great, right? Um, in that video you're referencing about Russia, what what Russia was saying is basically the US wants to put all the debt, the $37 trillion into the cryptocloud, put it all into stable coins and then inflate it away. &gt;&gt; And I was saying that's not really how it works because stable coins require $1 in to generate a dollar coin back in return. So, it's not like it was like gold and they they created more paper IOU certificates based off of that, right? the g the banks the crypto institutions that are doing stable coins aren't just creating those from thin air. So that's not really how it works and that's kind of what I was trying to explain. But I do think what's interesting is that uh Scott Bent, head of the US Treasury, if you think his job is to sell US treasuries, &gt;&gt; that's his job. He's got to get someone to buy the debt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And his job has been getting harder and harder because governments around the world know that they're getting debased, right? The IMF and the BIS both put out a white paper and it's titled the liquidation of government debt. And the liquidation of government debt, the white paper that they reference is using something called financial repression. &gt;&gt; And it's the playbook that both the the UK and the US ran after World War II. &gt;&gt; Yep. Yield curve control. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Which is basically to liquidate bond holders. And they liquidate bond holders by by paying less than inflation, right? And so all the bond holders around the world know they're being liquidated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Literally, right? So stealing 3 to 4% per year. What does that say about percent? So his job is to sell treasuries. Now he said that he predicts uh stable coins should reach 3.7 trillion by 2030. But what's interesting and I draw to I drew to in this video is that after 2008 we had this quantitative easing and so the Fed increased the monetary base and they gave the banks all this money and the banks are sitting on something called sterilized reserves and so they have money that's sitting aside and they're getting interest I from the Fed to leave it there but it's not allowed to get back into the retail into the public and that's why a lot of analysts will tell you that 2008 wasn't really inflationary because the money stayed at the banks. I have a beef with that because asset prices were highly inflationary, but they don't call that inflation. They call that appreciation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whatever. You got to buy a home. The home went up. Anyway, uh so they have they have 3.2 trillion sitting there. &gt;&gt; And I think what's interesting from my research, and I'm maybe reaching or making some speculation here, but it looks like the banks are sitting on that money and they could create stable coins against that because it's still set aside. &gt;&gt; So that's $3.2 two trillion dollars that could become stable coins and could get into the economy. And so that's what Trump wants. Obviously, he's been fighting with the Fed, right? He's calling Jerome Pal all kinds of names, too late, etc. And so they want to be able to have the Fed, which controls fiscal policy, have more um control over the monetary policy. And so they're trying to kind of control the Fed, but this is a way they could monetize that 3.2 trillion, which is pretty close to what Bent said of 3.7 trillion. And so based off the rate of stable uh stable coin growth right now, if you project that out, it looks like they'll hit that number by like 2027. So it's happening pretty quickly. And that's how they'll get the inflation that they need to grow the economy. Trump wants to let it run hot. When Musk left, he said that there's no hope. We have to grow a way out of it. Bassen said we have to grow a way out of it. And that's how they'll do it.
