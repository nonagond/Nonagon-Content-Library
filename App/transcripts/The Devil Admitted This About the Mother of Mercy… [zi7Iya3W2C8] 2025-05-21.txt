Kind: captions Language: en St. Alonsus tells a story about a priest who is performing an exorcism over a possessed man. And during the exorcism, the priest asks the demon in the possessed man, "What is Mary doing right now?" And the demon replied, "She's descending and ascending." St. Alphosus offers the reflection and say and says that is everything that Mary does. She descends to men to bring grace to us and then she ascends back to God to present our supplications and asks blessings upon them. Now have you ever wondered well how powerful then are Mary's requests before God? St. And some will say that sometimes we receive grace by Mary's intercession that we otherwise may have not received. And number two, we receive that grace quicker than compared to going directly to Jesus. Why? St. Alphonsus makes the point that when we go directly to Jesus, we are asking the one who has mercy on us, but also the one who executes justice. also the one who can punish. However, when we go to Mary, she only knows mercy. Think about this. When we talk about Jesus, we talk about him sometimes as the just judge. Yes, we talk about his mercy, but we also talk about his justice. But never does the church use this language when it's when referring to Mary. You you'll never hear Mary referred to as the just mother or the mother of vengeance. She's not referred to that way. But we have this title for her, mother of mercy. Like you draw your attention to the Hail Holy Queen. How does it go? Hail Holy Queen. Mother of mercy. Our life, our sweetness, and our hope. See, that's one value of praying traditional prayers. It forms your theology. It forms you. How you pray informs what you believe. And so here we have this traditional prayer informing us about the truth of Mary. She is the mother of mercy. In other words, when you go to her with a request, she only knows mercy. Now, I want you to imagine that you have committed a crime. You get caught. You're brought before the judge and you plead your defense. You say, "I I made a mistake. It was a lapse of judgment. Judge, please have mercy on me." How will it go? Well, the judge is not moved. And so then you think, what what else can you do? Well, instead of trying to defend yourself, maybe you bring in a high-profile lawyer, and they make a defense for you, asking for mercy. But the judge is still not moved. So what do you do? Well, perhaps you bring in somebody that knows you really well, a friend. And he comes in and they he give testimony to your character and how you're a good person. You just made a a lapse of judgment that this is really not you. But the judge is still not moved. What recourse then do you have? Then you have this wonderful idea. I will bring in the judge's mother. And so the judge's mother comes in and on your behalf speaks for you and he's moved. Why? Because the judge's mother Well, by the time the judge was born, he already owed her nine months of room and board. We all owe something to our mother, don't we? And likewise, it is with Jesus. He is moved when his mother comes to him and says, "Look, my son, this child here, yes, he may be guilty, but I ask for mercy." St. Alfonsus says, "She knows so well how to appease the divine justice with her tender and wise intreaties that God himself blesses her for it and as it were thanks her." St. Alfonsus quoting Richard of St. Lawrence says, "What poor sinners we should be if we had not this advocate, so prudent and so wise that the judge, her son, cannot condemn the guilty, if she defends them." How else can we understand Mary's requests before God? Well, St. Alfos says that Mary's requests appear to him as though they are commands but then adds one more thing that Mary's requests before God are all powerful. He he uses the word omnipotent. Now that's confusing because that word omnipotent meaning all powerful typically refers to only God himself. It's an attribute of God. So it's confusing. How is it possible that in the St. Alfosus's mind that Mary's requests are are all powerful? St. Alfasa says, "Thy help is omnipotent, O Mary." As Cosma of Jerusalem exclaims, "Yes, Mary is omnipotent, as Richard of St. Lawrence, since the queen by every law must enjoy the same privileges as the king. For as the power of the son and the mother are the same, the mother by the omnipotent son is made omnipotent. As St. Antonius says, God has placed the whole church not only under the patronage but also under the dominion of Mary. Now St. Alphonsus makes the distinction between Mary and Jesus. Later he says that Jesus is all powerful by nature but not Mary. Mary is all powerful by grace. And then he goes on to refer to this mystical experience that St. Bridget had when she overheard Jesus and Mary speaking. Jesus said, "Oh my mother, you know how I love thee. Ask from me then whatever you desire, for there is no demand of thine that will not be graciously heard by me." And the reason that Jesus gives this special privilege to Mary is this. Mother, when you were on earth, there was nothing you did refuse to do for love of me. Now that I am in heaven, it is just that I refuse nothing which you ask of me. So in what ways did Mary refuse Jesus nothing during her earthly life? Well, in so many just think about the enunciation alone. Gabriel, angel Gabriel, heaven to earth to Mary announces to her that she's going to have a king by the power of the Holy Spirit. You know, this is bad news for Mary. Why? Because she's engaged to Joseph. It's going to look like she slept around. And Deuteronomy 22:23 and 24 describes what should happen to a woman who's who's engaged to another man and sleeps with another and gets pregnant. Those two should be taken to the edge of the city and stoned to death. So, the proposition of the angel Gabriel to Mary is a potential death sentence. Yet she refuses Jesus nothing right from the very beginning. How does she respond? I am the handmade of the Lord. Let it be done to me according to thy word. And then think about the unusual birth of Jesus. They they go to the end but but there's no room so they end up in a stable. Usually a mom wants a nice comfy place to give birth. Mary didn't have this. And then think about what happens after Herod sends out soldiers to kill all the firstborn off to Egypt. Just from the beginning of Mary saying yes, there's all this inconvenience and threat to her life. She never grumbles. She never complains. She never says, "Oh, why did I say yes to that angel?" She refuses Jesus nothing. Not from the beginning but of his life but right through to the end right up to the cross to the passion where Jesus dies. Mary is there at the foot of the cross refusing Jesus nothing. So it's no wonder that St. Alasa says that Mary's prayers before Jesus are all powerful. St. And also says Mary is then called omnipotent in the sense in which it can be understood of a creature who is not capable of any divine attribute. She is omnipotent because she obtains by her prayers whatever she wishes. This is an incredible teaching by St. Alasus who's a doctor of the church. Remember that he's saying that Mary obtains everything she wishes. Wow. I mean, what do you wish for? I have a laundry list. It's pretty long. But Mary, whatever her whatever is on her list, she gets that. Which leads us to a very important question. What does Mary wish for? Later in the glories of Mary, St. Alasus talks about a mystical vision again of St. Bridget where she again overhears Mary and Jesus talking and Jesus again says to Mary ask from me whatever you wish. Now who else says that? Well, who else could say something like that? Only a person in power, right? Only a person of authority. And my mind immediately went to another person in scripture with authority who said something very similar. And it was Herod who said, "Ask for me anything you wish and it will be granted to you." He says this to the daughter of Herodiius. The daughter dances beautifully before Herod. He's so moved and captivated. Captivated. He's pleased with her and says, "Anything you ask for, it will be given to you." And what does she do? Goes to his her mother and she asks for the head of John the Baptist. This is what happens when you give power to an evil person. death. But what happens if you give power to a very good person? What happens? Life Mary not just good but perfected in all virtue. No sin. And her requests before Jesus are granted. So again, what does Mary ask for in this vision that St. Bridget had of Jesus and Mary? Jesus going to Mary and saying, "Ask of me anything you desire." What does Mary say? She replies, "I ask for mercy." I ask for mercy. You, my friend, have a mother of mercy. Practically, how does this play out in our lives? Couple questions for you. Are you in over your head in life? Are you overwhelmed with worries and anxieties? Is your body sick? Do you got problems with your kids? Do you have problems with finances? Has your heart been hardened by sin? And it feels like the love of God just cannot penetrate you. Do you struggle with faith? Intellectually, you know you should believe in God, but it doesn't translate to your prayer life. Doesn't translate to your actions. You feel God is distant in your life. I want to tell you, you have a mother of mercy. She's before Jesus and she says these words, "My son, I ask for mercy." So today, I invite you, place your life into the hands of Mary. Let her take her all your cares, all your worries and anxieties. And she presents them before Jesus as though they are her own. And she says, "My son, I ask for mercy." Friends, thanks for watching. Share with me below what stood out to. I'll see you soon. [Music]
