### Habit 1: The Gratitude Advantage

- Daily gratitude rewires your brain for success -- but not the generic "I'm grateful for food" kind
- Inspired by Napoleon Hill's *Think and Grow Rich* (written 1937, 100+ million copies sold), which shifted his entire mindset early in his career
- Three specific things to write down every single night:
  - **What did I learn today?** -- Reflect on lessons, even from bad experiences, and why you're grateful for them
  - **What else am I grateful for?** -- Broader gratitude items
  - **What did I do well?** -- Reinforce positive actions and progress
- Uses a Google Form to capture this nightly ritual (offered free to viewers)
- **Key insight**: "Optimism is mandatory for wealth creation" -- repeated for emphasis
  - Entrepreneurs and investors must believe in positive outcomes
  - Pessimists who focus on "what if this bad thing happens?" never get ahead
  - The mindset is: bad things WILL happen, and you'll figure out how to solve them

### Habit 2: The Capture Rule -- "If You Can Think It, Ink It"

- Your brain should be used for **creating** ideas, not **storing** them
- Uncaptured ideas rattle around causing stress, or worse, get forgotten
- "Time is so valuable -- you don't have the luxury of having the same thought twice"
- Evolution of his capture system:
  - Started with a physical notebook and pen
  - Moved to Evernote on iPhone (still maintains a "capture page" there)
  - Now uses a wearable AI device that records everything -- he just speaks and tags items (e.g., "take action") which route automatically to his assistant
- **Action step**: Capture every idea immediately using whatever tool works for you

### Habit 3: Win Your Morning, Win Your Day

- One of the worst things you can do: sit down in the morning and ask "what should I work on today?"
- **Pre-decide your tasks the night before** to eliminate morning procrastination
- Schedule creative work in the morning when your mind is freshest; save reviews and planning for the end of the day
- Nightly planning ritual (done in his Google Form):
  - **One main non-negotiable task** -- the single thing that must get done
  - **Three additional tasks** -- other important items for the day
- **Action step**: Tonight before bed, list out tomorrow's tasks with clear priorities

### Habit 4: Eat the Frog First

- Do your hardest, most important, most dreaded task first thing -- the rest of the day gets easier
- Personal example: working out at the gym
  - Lifted weights since age 15, always went after work
  - After marriage and kids, post-work gym became inconsistent
  - Solution: wake up 2 hours earlier to go before work
  - Spent years waking up in the dark, standing there thinking of every reason NOT to go -- but went anyway
  - Now it's so ingrained that skipping it would ruin his productivity for the entire day
- **Action step**: Identify your most critical task and do it first, before anything else competes for your energy

### Habit 5: Habit Stacking

- Connect new habits to existing habits to build them on autopilot
- Example: After the gym (existing habit), he immediately creates social media content (new habit)
- The framework:
  - Identify one thing you already do consistently (wake up, brush teeth, etc.)
  - Attach the new desired habit directly after it
- **Action step**: Write down one consistent habit you already have, write down one new habit you want to build, and stack them together

### Habit 6: The Time Vault

- Time is the most scarce resource in economics -- guard it fiercely
- Just like money, most people wonder "where did all my time go?" at the end of the week
- **Budget your time the same way you budget your money** -- plan in advance where it will go
- Respect your time AND others' time:
  - Don't default to 1-hour meetings if 10-15 minutes will do
  - When you respect others' time, they'll respect yours in return
- **Time audit**: Conducted multiple times per year
  - Track where ALL your time goes for two weeks
  - Review and adjust: spend more time here, less time there
  - Set new time blocks on your calendar accordingly
- **Action step**: Conduct a time audit -- measure where your time actually goes, then budget it intentionally

### Habit 7: The Decision Diet

- Decision fatigue is real -- simplify daily decisions to preserve energy and creativity
- All creative work goes in the morning (fresh mind); management, calls, and decisions go in the afternoon
- Examples of decisions he's eliminated:
  - **Clothing**: Wears a black shirt every single day -- no decision needed
  - **Lunch**: Eats the same thing every day -- no decision needed
  - **Haircuts**: Standing monthly appointment on autopilot
- "Fewer decisions mean more mental bandwidth for higher-value things"
- **Action step**: Identify recurring decisions (clothes, meals, appointments) and automate or standardize them so your cognitive energy goes toward what matters most

### Habit 8: Curate to Elevate

- Don't consume raw news -- consume **curated and analyzed** information
- Instead of reading every news site, subscribe to a handful of high-quality newsletters where experts have already filtered and analyzed the information
- His curated inputs cover: macro markets, tech markets, AI tools -- delivered daily
- **Quality inputs = quality outputs**
- Social media curation strategy:
  - On X/Twitter: maintains specific lists (macro, Bitcoin, AI coding, AI prompts) to follow signal, not noise
  - Instagram: follows zero friends -- only industry people and learning sources
- **Action step**: Curate your news feed intentionally -- build lists, subscribe to quality newsletters, eliminate noise

### Habit 9: The Idea Factory

- Creativity is a muscle that can be built intentionally
- His credentials: runs multiple eight-figure businesses, serves as adviser/CVO to four companies totaling over half a billion dollars -- brought on specifically for his pattern recognition and creative vision
- "I wasn't always this way. I did it intentionally."
- The method (from Brian Tracy): every morning, write down 10 ideas on paper
  - In the beginning, the ideas were terrible -- "just gibberish"
  - Over time, the quality improved dramatically
  - After 15 years of practice: "I can't turn it off. New ideas come at me non-stop."
- **Action step**: Start with 5 ideas every morning. Accept that they'll be bad at first. The muscle builds over time.

### Habit 10: Just-In-Time Learning

- "Knowledge is power" is wrong -- **only knowledge APPLIED is power**
- Learn on demand: study exactly what you need to solve the problem right in front of you
- Three levels of learning:
  1. **Receive** the information (read/watch)
  2. **Apply** the information immediately
  3. **Teach** the information to others
- His book library is extremely diverse (HR, marketing, history, scaling) because he reads what matches his current challenge
  - Hiring people? Read books on recruiting
  - Scaling the business? Read books on scaling
  - Building marketing campaigns? Read books on marketing
- **Action step**: Identify the ONE thing you need to know right now to move your biggest domino forward. Ignore everything else. Learn it. Apply it immediately.

### Habit 11: The Growth Budget

- The highest ROI investment is in your own personal growth
- Story: In 2008 during the financial crash, he got completely wiped out
  - Had built and sold businesses (big exits) but wasn't paying attention to global financial markets
  - Response: invested tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands of dollars into investment newsletters, coaching programs, and education
  - That knowledge can never be taken away -- he can deploy it again and again
- "Markets come and go. Businesses can crash. But knowledge of how markets and business work can never be taken from me."
- He attends 1-2 masterminds per year, typically costing $25,000-$50,000 each
- **Action step**: Budget money specifically for learning -- conferences, courses, programs, masterminds. Treat it like saving for a car or vacation.

### Habit 12: Autopilot Your Wealth

- Automate savings and pay yourself first to guarantee success
- The process:
  1. Decide what you want (vacation, car, education, etc.)
  2. Calculate how much you need and by when
  3. Determine what percentage of income to set aside
  4. **Automate it** so you never have to think about it again
- Banking structure:
  - All income flows into ONE primary account (never spend from this account)
  - Money auto-distributes to separate accounts for different purposes (car, loans, bills, etc.)
- Mentions a tool called **Get Sequence** for building automated financial workflows
- **Action step**: Set up automatic transfers from a central account to purpose-specific accounts. Spend the time upfront to think it through, then let automation handle it forever.

### Habit 13: Weekly Wealth Pulse

- Check your financial health weekly (like stepping on a scale once a week)
- Three financial reports to review every week (or at minimum, monthly):
  1. **Profit & Loss (P&L)**: How much money came in vs. how much went out -- applies to businesses AND personal W-2 income
  2. **Statement of Cash Flows**: Where did the money actually go?
  3. **Balance Sheet** (the "scorecard"): All assets minus all liabilities = net worth
     - "The goal in the game of building wealth is to take earned income and turn it into assets"
     - This report tells you how well you're playing that game
- He reviews these every Friday
- **Action step**: Pick a day each week, put it on your calendar, and review all three reports. If you don't have these reports, figure out how to create them.

### Habit 14: Income Insurance

- Diversify income sources so you're never dependent on a single stream
- Common misconception: "multiple income streams" does NOT mean starting multiple businesses
- His 2008 lesson: sold his businesses, put proceeds into investments, markets crashed -- had liabilities but zero income
- Diversification strategies:
  - **For business owners**: Don't rely on one customer; expand to multiple customers and multiple products within your core competency
  - A business with only one customer is worth very little because it's too risky
  - **For employees**: Your job is a single income source -- consider building side hustles, contract work, or at minimum, develop skills that could generate additional income if needed
- "At least have the skills... the one thing they can't take away"
- **Action step**: If you own a business, find more customers and launch more products. If you're employed, start building side skills or income streams.

### Habit 15: Build or Be Built

- Engineer your ideal life intentionally -- don't let it happen by default
- Coaching example: a wealthy member said he wasn't spending enough time with his wife, but when asked "how much time SHOULD you spend?" -- he had no answer
- Key questions to define your ideal life:
  - How much time with your spouse/kids?
  - What should your health look like?
  - What does your ideal average day look like?
- **Future pacing exercise**: Imagine your ideal average day in the future (not a fantasy dream day, but a realistic daily routine)
  - Where do you wake up? Are you married? What country/setting?
  - Do you work? On what? What gives you energy?
  - Do you spend time with family, friends? Doing what?
- "Once you figure out what you want your lifestyle to look like, then you can work backwards from there"
- **Action step**: Write out your ideal day in detail, summarize it into a single statement, print it out, and put it where you can see it daily so your mind starts working toward that goal

### Habit 16: The Legacy Lens

- Reflect daily on what your legacy is building towards
- Journaling at the end of the day supports this -- reviewing lessons learned and tracking progress
- "Legacy focus creates purposeful living"
- Pushback against society's default script: work 40 years, save for retirement, do nothing
  - That's not what people actually want -- they want purpose, meaning, and challenge
- Reflection questions:
  - What am I doing? What do I like? What do I hate?
  - What gives me energy? What drains my energy?
  - What do I want more of? What should I do less of?
  - What do I absolutely love? What do I absolutely hate?
- **Action step**: Write down answers to these questions, reflect on them regularly, and take action to move toward more of what you love and less of what you hate

### Habit 17: Blissfully Dissatisfied

- Concept borrowed from Ed Mylett's mindset -- balancing contentment with ambition
- The balance:
  - **Be content** with where you are and the progress you've made
  - **Keep pushing** to get better in all areas
- "Once we figured out what our core values are, the goal should just be to continue to get better at those"
  - Better husband/wife, father/mother, son/daughter
  - Better in your role/position
  - Better health and fitness
- The growth cycle: hope of achieving growth provides the energy FOR growth, and hope comes from believing you can achieve the goal
- **Action step**: Regularly assess four areas and push for growth in each:
  - Health goals
  - Relationship goals
  - Business goals
  - Personal goals

### The Compounding Effect

- These 17 habits may seem small individually, but combined together they create an extraordinary compounding effect
- They provide clarity, purpose, and massive impact
- The key to getting rich isn't dramatic lifestyle changes -- it's small daily habits that stack and compound over years, making wealth "not just easy, but inevitable"
