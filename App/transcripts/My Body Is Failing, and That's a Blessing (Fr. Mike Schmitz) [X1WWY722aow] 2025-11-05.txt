Kind: captions Language: en You were talking about old age and blowing out your body. So, what did you do? Shoulder surgery. &gt;&gt; So, yeah. No, I a year and a half ago I had back surgery. I had um &gt;&gt; Golly, is that from working out or? &gt;&gt; Well, I I was doing a heavy single and deadlift and uh and it was a weight I had done before and once before and I just, you know, went for it and halfway up I felt a little and I was like, "Okay, the first thought, my first thought was, oh shoot." My second thought was, I should finish this lift because I need to lock it out because this might be the last time I ever get to lift heavy again. And my third thought was, okay, from now on it is uh longevity over one rep maxes. And so so but that was that was the worst. For the next month, I had the worst pain in my entire life. I I have so much uh compassion now for people who have back pain because, you know, my thought was, "Oh, my back hurts." I'm like, "Okay, well maybe lie down, you know, and people people say that to me like, well, I see I heard that if you lie down, put your legs up kind of a thing." Like there was no escaping. There was no escaping. This pain that was shooting down my leg was was it there was no alleviating it. No matter how many like Advil or whatever it was I took, it didn't do. And so then I just I'm so grateful too for medicine because uh yeah, [sighs] I mean I have a sister who's an orthopedic surgeon. My dad was an orthopedic surgeon. I have a sister who's a PT. And so I'm like I'm texting them in the almost middle of the night saying what can I do? And they're like just you know we'll do your best. And um but in the last not the last minute but after a whole month of like trying trying trying to figure out what it was, they had done an MRI and my sister hooked me up with one of her fellow residents who was a spine specialist and got me in and he said, "We need to get you in now because there were some there were some bigger things happening." And I remember sitting there in the the preop room with my dad who he he had done hundreds of these surgeries on people. And he just said he said imagine if this happened 60 years ago and you were like you know a manual laborer like what you would do because there's nothing you can do. There's no amount of massage or therapy or needling or anything like this. Just there's nothing you can do. The a speak piece of the of the disc had broken off and was pressing against the nerve. And I just I just thought man some people that was their lives that was their entire lives. I went under and woke up however long later and it was gone. like the pain was just gone. And I just it was one of those situations where I can't even think about it now. This is a year and a half ago. I can't even think about it now without being so overwhelmed with gratitude because even that week, the week before, that was a Friday. I remember I heard got hurt on a Friday. That week I thought cuz my dad has some back issues. I thought, "Ah, Lord, thank you so much for I have a healthy body." Like, "Thank thank you so much that my back is, you know, strong." And then that Friday like, "Okay." And so that was, you know, then kind of trying to recover from that, which is a whole another story. &gt;&gt; But I mean, surgery is not optimal unless you need it. Yeah. I mean, how did you how was your recovery? &gt;&gt; That was the thing is is um so I had this shoulder issue for years now. I'd gone into physical therapy and then it would hurt again. And so I had an M MRI on the shoulder before the back. And my sister, the orthopedic surgeon, is like, "You have to go in. I have a great surgeon. She'll take care of it." Da da da. And uh I just like I can't I can't stop. I can't slow down. I can't do this. And so I put it off. But then when the back hurt, it was oh, I need to do this. Wasn't an option. It was it was a necessity. And and then it was okay, what do I need to change? What do I need to shift around this summer? So because it was in May, uh so that I can take the next 10 weeks because it was a it was pretty big. They were the the doctor was very specific about the restrictions. And he said like you can you can royally screw this up if you don't listen to these restrictions which are no bending, twisting or lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk for the next 6 weeks. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; And so I was like he's like and he kind of challenged me and I'm like no I'm on your side like I'm on team. Let's not do this again. And so it was &gt;&gt; and did you get to have time off or &gt;&gt; No, I I had to keep going. I I I had one week or so actually. It was fascinating. I uh not fascinating to me I guess. The surgery was on a Tuesday and I had to give a talk at a local regional eucharistic congress um that Saturday and so I'm so grateful the ascension people they were going to be there in Baiji Minnesota um but I'm like I don't think I can do it like I don't think I can make it there &gt;&gt; that we can come to you so they came to Duth and set up a studio we filmed the talk and then uh I got to rest for the next five days um but then had to travel got to travel um and uh got to say, "I'm sorry. Could you I can't pick up this bag. Could you help me put this up?" &gt;&gt; Was that difficult? &gt;&gt; Not at all. &gt;&gt; No. Not Not asking people, but I mean, not being able to pick up anything heavier than a gallon of milk. Did you realize just how many things in existence were heavier than a gallon of milk? &gt;&gt; I became the uh Can you help me, please? Can you help me, please? I mean, I [clears throat] because there was there was the the fear of like, "Oh, no. I know what &gt;&gt; this pain was like. I'm going to do exactly what they tell me to do." Um kind of out [clears throat] of Yeah, that fear. So it was if anything remotely was that backpack &gt;&gt; um that was uh people were like this is too heavy. I'm like yeah but if I keep it close to my body it'll be fine. So that was where I kind of pushed the line. &gt;&gt; The college of St. Joseph the worker is an amazing college where students combine higher education with hands-on trades and Catholic formation. Go to college of st joseph.com/mattfrad. &gt;&gt; Where's the back? &gt;&gt; So okay let's talk about working out because working out is very good. I I do weight training three times a week, but it's nothing like cross I used to do CrossFit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember. &gt;&gt; Um, but I am sort of afraid of doing what you did to your body and I'm always overly cautious and the more I hear stories like that, the more I pat myself on the back [laughter] for that fact. &gt;&gt; Super good. &gt;&gt; Um, so what have you like how have you dialed things back since? &gt;&gt; So that that's been an interesting thing I think. Um, [clears throat] so as I mentioned that was last summer with the back and then in the fall like the shoulder just like again kind of a pop at thing &gt;&gt; just during working out you have to stop &gt;&gt; and but the thing is and the thing is so I I had scaled back from doing all the things that hurt it &gt;&gt; and I was doing something that never had hurt in the past. I was like this is fine I can do this and I was like ah shoot. So he gone into PT again. I got an injection didn't help at all and so I was like okay we need to do this. So then we scheduled the the the surgery uh again right after the school year ended and so I was able to uh we had all those online masses and things we kind of was able to kind of backlog them or uplog them I don't know pre-log them and uh so I went in for the surgery it was so interestingly okay so you mentioned &gt;&gt; you're unconscious for both surgeries &gt;&gt; yes so grateful for that as well &gt;&gt; seriously I want to ask the dentist to do that to me when she has to put a filling in &gt;&gt; uh the shoulder one was, you know, the back was constant pain and so waking up was a relief. The shoulder was okay, waking up and now I'm immobilized for the next 6 weeks &gt;&gt; and can't do anything with my right arm and it's massive pain like in &gt;&gt; comparatively the back was before surgery was just excruciating. after surgery. Amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was the opposite for the shoulder. Shoulder I was like even the the day before I was like, "Wait, why am I doing this surgery again?" Cuz I was doing some movements and I'm like, "This is fine." And then I did another I'm like, "Okay, it's not fine." But afterwards, it was Yeah, it was it was &gt;&gt; after the surgery. I wish that maybe you had done more PT and not done the surgery. &gt;&gt; No, no, I knew I needed it cuz they had some imaging of it where everything is torn inside there, so they needed to do it. And um &gt;&gt; but it was Yeah, it was good recovery. &gt;&gt; So, how do you work out now? So, &gt;&gt; obviously it's important to keep working out, but &gt;&gt; they said the first six weeks are immobilize and protect, the second six weeks are range of motion, and then the next six weeks are you can start strengthening. So, I'm in that third set of six weeks. &gt;&gt; Oh, right now. You know what's scary is when you see part of your body atrophy. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. &gt;&gt; So, I tore my MCL like I told you a couple of months ago and I was getting some platelet injections. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That hurts a lot. &gt;&gt; Does it really? &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; I thought about it for the shoulder. &gt;&gt; It hurt me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they take your blood, they put it in a centuge, spin it around, and it separates the I don't know the blood [laughter] &gt;&gt; from the plates from the &gt;&gt; platelets in the blood. &gt;&gt; And then he did five injections in my knee &gt;&gt; really. &gt;&gt; And I was laying there and I said, "Could you please lie to me and tell me that this will be fine?" He's like, "Yeah, yeah, you'll just experience the discomfort." All those lies. &gt;&gt; Discomfort. &gt;&gt; And the injection didn't hurt, but as he pushed something into a space that didn't need it, &gt;&gt; every it felt like fire in my knee. And then my entire body began to sweat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'm not sure why my body thought that was necessary or how that was going to help me. &gt;&gt; But it hurt a lot. Yeah. But anyway, why did I bring up my knee? &gt;&gt; Atrophy. &gt;&gt; Atrophy. So he said I squeezed both my quads and I could see it. That's that's scary. &gt;&gt; Oh, so so with the leg with the back um my right uh vasis mediialis, which is the kind of the the quad on the inside of your leg. Um that way went numb. So the outside was on fire for a month and the inside went numb. I couldn't fire it at all. And so it's still a year later still smaller. You can tell if I have shorts on. It's like, "Oh, hey." [laughter] Yeah, that that that little teardrop is a smaller teardrop than the other. Um but then the arm my arm is just tiny. It is I was like &gt;&gt; and then my shoulder the whole thing and and everyone's like be patient. I'm like oh I'm not complaining. I'm just observing [laughter] &gt;&gt; that that it's it is &gt;&gt; so interesting how quickly &gt;&gt; I mean we're so fragile which is it is remarkable and I I've been I've been really grateful to that be able to reflect on this not in an abstract way but in a concrete way of &gt;&gt; of just even even even something like the healing of stitches um that I was thinking about this this morning actually at one point was it last fall two falls ago I had this like bump in the side of my And my sister was like, "Oh yeah, it's a cyst of some kind sort." I'm like, "Well, could you cut it out?" She's like, "Sure." So I laid down on my living room floor. And she put, you know, some things behind my head and and cut me open and pulled it out and &gt;&gt; love stitch me up. And I thought, "Okay, get a couple stitches. We're good. Now we're good to go." She's like, "Oh, no. You can't &gt;&gt; you can't exercise for like six weeks or sorry, six days, 10 days, something like this." And I was like, "What? Oh, really?" And it takes the reality. And this is sounds so stupid to say. I don't have Wolverine's healing factor. &gt;&gt; It's just like, no, it's just like a normal human being. It takes a long time for those things to heal. And sometimes they don't ever heal. Like, oh, wow. Yeah, that's true. Um, &gt;&gt; and there's something a big blessing about I and I really mean it in the sense I've been trying to &gt;&gt; look at it the right way and not complain. Um but the reality of how I think as we age things need to start failing. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Or I remain attached. And so there's this piece of there where I just for me maybe maybe it's just for me. I don't know. I think but I think it's for the for human race. I think we um or I get so attached to well here's what I'm going to do. Here's what life is going to be like. here is um &gt;&gt; I'll always feel this way. I always be able to see like now eyesight's failing, ear eyeballs, the earballs, everything's fading. Um there's something about that that's just like, okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that is hard. It's not just you're being detached from bad habits, but being detached from things that you thought were good. Like, you know, I want to be in shape. I think I I take kind of pride in being strong or what have you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or even just take pleasure in it. Some there's something, you know, rewarding about &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you're mentioning like working out um and realizing that it's it's really diff it's been kind of difficult. It's been a challenge after the back to come back and say, "Okay, uh how can I what what are my new goals that that are interiorly or internally um meaningful, challenging, and yet attainable in some ways, you know, where where it's like before it's like, oh, just go just we keep apparently we're just getting stronger and stronger and then it's like, oh, maybe we're not." M &gt;&gt; and so it's been a it's been a a decent learning experience of I'd say I'm probably the least healthy I've ever been. Um even though I'm I work out I don't know five to six times a week but still. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for watching that Pints with Aquinus clip.
