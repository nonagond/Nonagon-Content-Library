### Millionaire #1 -- Online Fitness Coaching Business (LinkedIn Ads, ~$3.7K LTV)

- **Current situation**: Scaled entirely on a single lead source -- LinkedIn ads targeting professionals. Lead quality is amazing. Offers one program with three timelines: 3-month ($2K), 6-month ($3K), 12-month ($5K). Most popular is the 6-month program. Closing above 40%.
- **Problem**: Marketing -- not enough ads, not enough creative. Struggles to remain profitable above ~$1,500/day in ad spend.

- **Advice #1 -- Switch to a diagnostic sale model**:
  - Instead of selling packages by duration, sell the goal itself
  - Price it per week (e.g., $129/week) and multiply by however many weeks the client needs to reach their goal
  - Example: "You're 200 lbs, want to be 160 -- that's 40 lbs at 1 lb/week = 40 weeks x $129"
  - Add a guarantee: "If you don't hit the goal by that point, I'll keep working with you until you do, provided you follow XYZ"
  - "As soon as you do that, you're selling the goal rather than selling programs -- you'll convert a way higher percentage of people"
  - This also naturally increases LTV since longer programs can include maintenance periods

- **Advice #2 -- Add supplement sales**:
  - You can usually get another 50% revenue in supplement sales with zero delivery burden
  - Don't sell on the first package; sell on the second meeting (48-hour follow-up nutrition consult)
  - First half of the meeting = nutrition consult; second half = assumed close on supplements
  - Use a habit-stacking technique: "What do you do in the morning? Put these three supplements next to your coffee. Going to the gym? Put pre-workout in your car."
  - Can generate $500-$2,000 in supplement revenue per client

- **Advice #3 -- Solve the ad creative bottleneck**:
  - The real constraint isn't the ad spend ceiling -- it's not creating enough new creative
  - Need to produce more creative every week to keep scaling

### Millionaire #2 -- Spanish Language Coaching for Professionals (Meta Ads, ~$3K LTV)

- **Current situation**: Sells Spanish coaching to professionals. Running ~$10K/month on Meta ads. Getting a 3:1 return. Getting lots of leads but many are low-salary profiles. Considering switching to LinkedIn or Twitter to reach higher-salaried executives.
- **Problem**: Lead quality -- too many low-salary leads. Wants to reach executives with more budget.

- **Advice #1 -- Don't turn off what's working**:
  - "Don't stop a flow -- keep making money with it. Just make more money by doing the other thing on top."
  - Never kill a profitable channel; add new ones alongside it

- **Advice #2 -- Add a performance/upsell component to increase LTV first**:
  - Adding a performance-based upsell to the existing program could take LTV from ~$3K to ~$10-12K per customer
  - This changes the math: 3:1 ROAS becomes 12:1 ROAS
  - Even with diminishing returns at higher spend (3:1 dropping to 2:1), with the new LTV it's still 9:1 -- "you're still killing"
  - "I would do that first before I even start another platform -- you might just be fine and just need to tweak the LTV"

### Millionaire #3 -- Real Estate Wholesaling Business (Sales Team Crisis)

- **Current situation**: Was closing ~70 deals/month, now down to ~40. Sales manager left (culture issues), top closer was promoted to sales manager, second top closer left for another offer. Lead flow is the same -- the drop is purely a sales team problem.
- **Problem**: Sales leadership vacuum. New sales manager (promoted from top closer) can't coach -- he's a killer, not a teacher. Considering hiring a sales director above the sales manager.

- **Advice #1 -- The CEO should get into sales personally**:
  - "You have a sales-driven business. You're the CEO. You should know how it works."
  - If you don't understand sales yourself, whoever runs sales will always have leverage over you
  - "If a sales director says 'No one can run this team like me, double my pay or I'm leaving,' you should be able to say 'I can name 10 people in this building who can do it better because I trained all of them.'"

- **Advice #2 -- How to actually train a sales team (Sales Training 101)**:
  - "95% of companies have no idea how to train sales. They just hire salespeople and hope for the best."
  - People get better at sales through two things:
    1. **Watching game tape** of people who sell well -- modeling, just like children learn
    2. **Corrective, immediate role-playing** -- drill one aspect of the script until they breathe it: "When this happens, what do you say? Great. Say it again like this. Try again. Awesome. Keep going."
  - Work through the script section by section until reps can do it without thinking about what they're going to say next -- so they can actually listen on the call
  - The best sales trainers are NOT usually the top closers -- it's a different persona. Top closers are killers; good managers are caring, attentive people who genuinely want to help others improve

- **Advice #3 -- Make the script the Bible**:
  - "Everyone follows the script. The script becomes the Bible -- word of God."
  - If everyone follows the script perfectly and they don't close, that's a win -- because now you can tweak the script and it actually changes how everyone performs
  - "If no one says a script to begin with, why do we even bother having a script?"
  - Make the script as simple as humanly possible -- "Most times when we look at a script, we cut half of it"

- **Advice #4 -- Don't promote your best closer to manager**:
  - "A song as old as time" -- best closer becomes manager and can't coach because they're a killer, not a teacher
  - The promoted closer still sees teammates as competition from a week ago

### Millionaire #4 -- Used Car Dealership (Eight Years, ~$500-600K Profit)

- **Current situation**: Started as a pipe welder, bought some cars, built up to 100 vehicles on lot plus a full-time service shop. Has been branding through radio. Scaling from 15 to 30 to 45 to 100 cars. Hasn't taken much money out -- reinvests everything. Has access to commercial vans with $6-12K margins vs. $2K margins on typical cars.
- **Problem**: Key man problem. Needs to hire mechanics, service writers, and leadership. Has multiple growth opportunities (van niche, service shop expansion) but no bandwidth.

- **Advice #1 -- You don't have problems, you need people**:
  - "When I hear six problems, it's people. You need help."
  - "You're missing three smart people": someone to run the mechanic/service division, someone to run the used car lot, and then you can pursue the van opportunity
  - "You can't pursue a new opportunity when you've got another new opportunity (the service business) which you're spinning up, while still keeping the wheels on the core cash cow business"

- **Advice #2 -- Hire a finance person first (controller or CFO)**:
  - "I'll bet you could probably get close to doubling your margin just from somebody who had some finance discipline"
  - Pitch to the hire: "I can't afford you. I'm willing to pay you this. You need to find your salary and cost savings in the next 90 days."
  - "They'll find it, and then they'll say 'cool, I just bought myself -- let's see what else we can find'"
  - The finance person will identify cost savings that carve out the budget for the next operational hire

- **Advice #3 -- The ideal hire profile**:
  - Someone who has taken a dealership from $5-10M in receivables to $25-30M with a strong financial background
  - If you can't find that, look for someone from another car dealership that's been a bit bigger, with finance discipline and growth experience

- **Advice #4 -- You need to buy more expensive time**:
  - "You're at the point where you need to make a bet on trading -- you need to buy some time back, and the time you need to buy is now more expensive time"
  - Just like ad spend thresholds ($5K/day, $10K/day, $100K/day), talent has thresholds too: $250K/year, $500K/year, $1M/year
  - "Right now I think you've just never paid someone what you're going to have to pay this person"

### Millionaire #5 -- Enterprise Web Development Agency (Two Co-Founders, Whale Client Dependency)

- **Current situation**: Builds custom websites for enterprise clients (1,000+ employees, 1M+ page views/day). Banking, digital media, marketing. Two co-founders split roles: one handles sales + finance, the other handles marketing + HR + operations. Revenue is concentrated in two big whale clients (~90% of revenue). Outbound sales has been dead for the past year.
- **Problem**: Over-reliance on two whale clients. Outbound sales not happening because the co-founder responsible for sales keeps getting pulled into client delivery work.

- **Advice #1 -- You have a co-founder conversation to have, not a sales problem**:
  - "You presented with a sales problem, but I think you have a hard conversation with a co-founder to have"
  - Division of roles is critical: "I will take over 100% of delivery if you go get us customers. If you don't get us customers, then one of us isn't necessary."
  - One co-founder appears satisfied with current income and workload, creating conflict

- **Advice #2 -- The difference between insult and criticism**:
  - An insult is an attack on someone's character: "You suck. You're an idiot."
  - A criticism is a statement about discrepancy between what was said and reality: "You said you would hit this goal. This is reality. There's a difference. Here's what we can do to make that up."
  - Use criticism, not insults: "You are responsible for sales. We have no sales. This gap is the problem."

- **Advice #3 -- Force the honest conversation**:
  - "Don't pull the punches. Be like: this is what I want. You're not doing that. That's my fault too because I probably haven't been clear about it. But let me be clear now."
  - "If you don't want to do that, fine -- let's figure out a way that we can work on separate things, because I want to keep growing."
  - Unresolved conflict turns into either direct conflict or resentment

### Millionaire #6 -- Anime/Japanese Culture E-Commerce Clothing Brand (Discord Community, 14K Members)

- **Current situation**: Sells clothing inspired by Japanese culture/anime. Built a Discord community of 14,000+ members who are highly engaged and among the highest-converting customers. Created an original character (Nasca) and a universe around it. Long-term vision: create their own anime, expand the IP universe.
- **Problem**: Should resources go toward scaling the clothing sales (the economic engine) or building out the character universe (long-term IP)?

- **Advice #1 -- It's not either/or -- fund the IP from the economic engine**:
  - "You need to keep selling clothing to pay for the bills to do all the rest of the stuff"
  - Think of the universe-building as marketing spend, capped based on ROI
  - "Take the profit from the clothing and reinvest more into building out cool media for the character"

- **Advice #2 -- The IP investment should show measurable growth**:
  - "If you pour money into it and more people don't find out about your stuff, which doesn't create more people buying, then it's not working"
  - The character media and the commerce need a symbiotic relationship
  - "Mickey Mouse has to sell shirts, hats, t-shirts, movies"

- **Advice #3 -- Study the masters**:
  - "Study the hell out of Walt Disney. Read everything that's ever been written on him."
  - Look at modern examples like Gary Vee's VFriends -- characters with commerce (cards, shirts, merch)
  - Study how IP is built with commerce attached from the start

- **Advice #4 -- Never say "creating value out of nothing" (especially tied to NFTs)**:
  - "I would just never say those words again... especially tied to NFTs"

### Millionaire #7 -- Cannabis Paid Advertising Agency ($600K Revenue, ~$90K Profit)

- **Current situation**: Solo operator running a paid advertising agency specifically for cannabis companies. Four months into active operation. Revenue is $600K but most of that is pass-through ad spend -- actual profit/take-home is ~$90K/year. Has never hired anyone, never run payroll. Feels like he's at the "scraping by to pivot" phase.
- **Problem**: Wants to hire people but doesn't have the profit to cover payroll. Feels stuck.

- **Advice -- You don't have a people problem, you have a model problem**:
  - "You have $90K a year to work with. You have no room to hire people."
  - "You either need to fix your model... the way you're charging or billing, you're offering too much for too little"
  - The founder (always the most valuable employee early on) is working all hours to make $90K -- the model is broken
  - Two paths to fix it:
    1. **10x efficiency**: Make delivery 10 times more efficient so you can serve 10x the customers with the same effort
    2. **10x price**: Charge 10 times more per customer for what you're currently doing
  - "Trying to scale what you're currently doing is a bad idea. You need to fix what you're currently doing so that you can scale it."
  - At $900K/year profit with just yourself, then you talk about hiring. At $90K, the business model needs to be rebuilt first.

### Millionaire #8 -- Garage Door Company ($7M Revenue, $1.5M Cash Flow, Acquired via Buy)

- **Current situation**: Owns four auto body shops, pivoted into garage doors (highly fragmented industry, only two big players). Has been installing SOPs, checklists, processes (uses Trainual). Revenue is ~$7M with $1.5M cash flow. Currently gets almost all leads from home warranty companies (eight of them). Does virtually zero marketing -- about one organic marketing lead per month. About to start SEO, PPC, and possibly Facebook ads. Also planning acquisitions in the space.
- **Problem**: Single-channel lead risk (home warranty companies). Needs to build a marketing engine from scratch.

- **Advice #1 -- Start with vendors, then bring in-house**:
  - "Whenever I do anything in a new channel, I start with vendors. I tell them I'm going to take over in six months -- you help me train the person, and then eventually I won't need you."
  - This is directly from the agency chapter in his book *Leads*

- **Advice #2 -- PPC first (via agency), then social media ads (in-house)**:
  - **PPC (Google Ads)**: Go with a vendor/agency. "PPC will be harder to crack initially but then once you have it, it's very stable." For local, there are great agencies that can handle it well.
  - **Social media (Meta ads)**: Must be in-house. "I have yet to see people who don't do huge companies do a good job" at local social media ads through agencies. Creative gets tired in local markets every 2-3 weeks, so you need constant new creative.
  - Hire a younger person who understands local paid social. Give them an exciting mini-comp structure. They become a weapon -- especially for acquisitions where you can immediately triple acquired businesses' lead flow.

- **Advice #3 -- SEO is more skill-dependent but local is winnable**:
  - "SEO is more complicated... there's more skill in SEO than PPC, in my opinion"
  - "The nice thing is that local is easy to win compared to national"
  - Can also use an agency approach for SEO

- **Advice #4 -- Keep expanding the warranty channel too**:
  - Go from 8 home warranty partners to 20+
  - Don't abandon what's working; stack new channels on top

- **Advice #5 -- Read the agency chapter in the Leads book**:
  - Covers the exact playbook for cracking every new marketing channel: buy the agency, learn from them, train your person, take over

### Millionaire #9 -- Paid Ads Agency (Google + Meta, Targeting $100K+/Month Spenders)

- **Current situation**: 12 years of Google Ads experience, also does Meta. Entire pipeline comes through affiliates and referral partners. Wants to focus on clients spending $100K+/month (high-value accounts are easy to service; sub-$100K accounts are much harder). Worried about client churn from companies wanting to bring ads in-house.
- **Problem #1**: Not enough SQLs (sales qualified leads) for the $100K+/month niche. **Problem #2**: Clients eventually want to replace the agency and bring it in-house.

- **Advice #1 -- Proactively offer the transition to consulting**:
  - Bring it up front: "This is the first part (done-for-you). Whenever you want to bring this in-house, we'll switch to consulting and mentor the transition."
  - "We'll stay on a consulting basis until your team outperforms what we were doing. If they never outperform, you stay on consulting forever."
  - Shifts the relationship from subservient service provider to teacher/consultant -- "totally different vibe, actually kind of fun"
  - Extends LTV and aligns interests
  - Price the consulting phase at ~20-30% of previous done-for-you fees (e.g., ~3% of ad spend instead of 10%)

- **Advice #2 -- Go outbound for $100K+ clients**:
  - You need to go get what you want -- it has to be outbound: cold call, cold DM
  - Make content that is extremely niched to call out those high-value prospects
  - Use your own ad expertise and run targeted campaigns (likely LinkedIn) specifically for $100K+/month spenders
  - Be exclusionary in messaging: "If you're not spending $100K a month, please just scroll past this ad -- don't mess up my pixel"

### Millionaire #10 -- Dental Implant Practice (15 Years, Google Ads Dependent)

- **Current situation**: Dentist for 15 years, specializes in dental implants. About half of patients come from internal referrals, half from Google Ads. Had the same Google Ads agency with the same landing page for 8 years -- lead quality has declined. Recently partnered with a new company (failed), now working with another to build a proper funnel with video, social proof, and content. Differentiator: offers additional procedures for long-term predictability, plus a 10-15 year track record of successful patients. Currently prices slightly below market and adds more value.
- **Problem**: Should he focus on Google Ads funnel first and content second? Should he keep his current pricing strategy or raise prices?

- **Advice #1 -- Just raise the price**:
  - "My favorite way of doing it would be just raise your price"
  - You don't need to justify it: "You raise it because you want to. It's America. You can charge what you want. They can choose to say no."
  - Story: Acquired a company, doubled the price. Sales team said the same script with a different number at the end. Settled on a 50% increase -- and close rates went UP because they were mispriced
  - "We sold a higher percentage of people at 50% more money... that's the beautiful thing with price increases -- it's all profit"

- **Advice #2 -- You already have a sales process, you just haven't documented it**:
  - "I'll bet if I recorded you and played 50 of those [consultations] side by side, you'd see the same jokes, same questions, same flow"
  - Document it, then train the team on it so they can carry the process

- **Advice #3 -- Learn ads yourself before delegating**:
  - Endorsed the approach of learning Google Ads and Facebook Ads personally before handing off
  - "I can't delegate until I have full in-depth knowledge" -- this is the right instinct

- **Advice #4 -- The ultimate play is acquiring other practices**:
  - Once the marketing engine and systems are dialed in, start buying other dental practices
  - Install your systems, reputation, and vertically integrated lab on top of acquired practices
  - "That's when this gets a lot more interesting"

### Overarching Themes Across All 10 Conversations

- **Fix the model before trying to scale**: If the business model doesn't produce enough margin per unit of effort, scaling just amplifies the problem (Cannabis agency, Fitness coaching)
- **Price increases are the highest-leverage move**: Raising prices is all profit, often doesn't hurt close rates, and sometimes improves them (Dental practice, Cannabis agency)
- **Don't kill what's working -- stack new channels on top**: Never turn off a profitable channel to test a new one (Spanish coaching, Garage door company)
- **LTV fixes solve multiple problems at once**: Improving lifetime value makes ad spend, diminishing returns, and profitability issues all easier (Spanish coaching, Fitness coaching)
- **You need people, not more ideas**: At a certain scale, the bottleneck is always talent -- three smart people can transform a business (Car dealership, Garage door company)
- **Division of roles and accountability in partnerships**: Co-founders must have clear ownership with measurable outcomes, and hard conversations must happen (Web dev agency)
- **Sales training is about drilling scripts, not lecturing**: Watch game tape, role-play correctively, make the script the Bible, and keep it simple (Wholesaling business)
- **Start with vendors/agencies, then bring in-house**: Learn the channel through a vendor, train your person, and take over within 6 months (Garage door, Paid ads agency)
- **The CEO must understand the core function**: If sales drives the business, the CEO must know sales -- otherwise anyone in that seat has leverage over you (Wholesaling business, Dental practice)
