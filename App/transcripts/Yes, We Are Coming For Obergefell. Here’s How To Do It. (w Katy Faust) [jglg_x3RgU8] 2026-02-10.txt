Kind: captions Language: en The purpose of marriage law policy should be to protect children's rights. But in the United States, that has not been the case for over a decade. In 2015, a Supreme Court case squeezed kids out of marriage law and prioritized adult desires over children's well-being. Same-sex marriage became the law of the land in the case of Oberfel v. Hajj a marriage case that forced a marriage policy centered not on families or children but on the desires of adults. Now marriage would be between any two consenting adults male female male male and female female. Marriage in law became an entirely new thing. It was a legally absurd case. It had no historical basis in the text, structure, or logic of the constitution and was contrary to all evidence of historical understandings at the time the amendment had been adopted. The reactions to a burger, both for and against, have largely centered on the adults getting married. Pro-gay marriage advocates talked about a win for civil rights, the rights of any two adults to get married and shed homophobic social exclusions. dissenters quietly shifted to the abortion fight, trans surgeries on kids, or attacks on religious freedom. Challenging Oberafel was a pipe dream until now. Katie Fast and her organization, Them Before Us, has highlighted for years the true victims of the Oberfell decision, children. And today they are touching the third rail of politics. How the redefinition of marriage has weakened the bonds of mothers and fathers with their own children both in law and in culture. And now she's on a mission to save the orphans of Oberafell. Here's Katie Fast. Katie Fast, welcome back to Loopcast. We have talked before about your work with them before us and your personal journey um to where you are today. But we are together now to talk about your new campaign greater than and Catholic vote is so excited to help sponsor this campaign and to join you in this effort. So let's just start it off with give me the elevator pitch for greater than. &gt;&gt; The elevator pitch is hey America you get to choose. Do you want gay marriage or do children have a right to their mother and father? Pick one. You can't have both. And we've seen over the last 10 years that with the SCOTA's mandated gay um gay marriage regime that they insisted that all 50 states adopt that what we have seen is the slow but deliberate deconstruction of children's right, their claim to their own mother and father. We have now reduced children to legal accessories in a lot of different ways because like many of us warned leading up to Oberafell when you make husbands and wives optional in marriage mothers and fathers will become optional in parenthood law. The problem of course is that for the child their mother or father are never optional. Children need their mom and dad for the well for a variety. They need that man and woman for their identity formation because that man and woman are most likely to ensure that they are safe and loved because then they are going to have both the maternal and paternal love that maximizes their development because that excludes unrelated adults from the home that always increase risk of abuse and neglect. So the redefinition of marriage cost children their identity, their safety, their development and their heart's desires. So, Greater Than is a coalition of a huge swath of conservatism, religious leaders, political influencers, policy organizations that are simply standing up and saying enough. It's time for us to roll this back and retake marriage on behalf of children. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you had a fire article in the Federalist to kind of kick this off. And I'm going to point everyone to that if you want to read more. It's almost a manifesto of what you're doing with greater than. But I wanted to talk to you specifically. you mention on the website which again we'll direct everyone to that you mentioned on the website sort of three prongs of this effort and they are the judicial and policy strategy the uh changing public opinion which I'm very interested in uh and also uh church transformation changing our Christian churches back into or maybe reclaiming our original Christian heritage as child centered fighting forces in the culture. So, I just wanted to walk through those three prongs um a little bit to give people a a more strategic idea of what you're going to be doing um and also ask you maybe at the end which you think will be the most challenging for the coalition. Um but in terms of policy and judicial activism first um clearly the white whale here is the Oberafel decision. It's bad law. It's bad constitutional historical reading. It's almost absurd. Um, but how do you get there to overturning Obe Burgerell from where we are today when so many states in the last 11 years have passed legislation? We're going to talk about California in a few minutes. Um, passed legislation based on that. Um, and what other initiatives sort of tertiary or supportive initiatives should we be supporting in terms of law and policy? We have some policy recommendations for state level lawmakers who would like to start to unwind the damage of Oberafell, but um and so we don't talk specifically about those policy recommendations, but I will just give you an overview. What gay marriage required, what it mandated was the flattening of all distinctions within the family. because once the natural contours of the natural family are emerged and acknowledged, it doesn't look very equal because it always insists on a man and a woman. And so what we've seen over the last 10 years is stripping parenthood laws of the words mother and father. And if you go down to your local jurisdiction, um it'll probably trickle down to your school districts. You won't see forms asking for mother and father anymore. It'll say guardians. It'll say parent one, parent two. because even saying the words mother and father felt like discrimination, right? So, we had to pull out any acknowledgement of the gendered aspect of the family in the name of equality for adults. Uh we've also seen new pathways to parenthood that have been elevated, especially in states that have passed the Uniform Parentage Act. California is one of those that that is a way of systematizing all of the parentage laws in a state. And that was updated in 2017 in the name of, oh, now we have gay marriage. Now saying mother and father could constitute discrimination. Oh, now we need to acknowledge that unrelated adults should be able to put their names on children's birth certificates. And so the Uniform Parentage Act created new pathways for adults to acquire children. The legitimate way for somebody to claim responsibility of a vulnerable infant is that baby was born to you or you're the genetic parent or you went through a rigorous screening process through the state to prove that you would be just as likely to love and care for this child as if they had been born to you through an adoption process. But both of those pathways felt like uh undignified uh you know unjust because it was disproportionate treatment for same-sex couples who can never both be biologically related. It just points that these two pairings are very different. So they created new pathways to acquire children called intentbased parenthood or deacto parenthood which is really just state sanctioned child trafficking. It just says if you can assemble sperm egg and womb and you have a valid contract the state will hand that baby to you. So, we've also seen the redefinition of infertility. It's no longer a medical condition of a heterosexual couple with unprotected sex that doesn't result in a pregnancy or life birth after 12 months. Um, and then some of those couples could then turn to their insurance company for, you know, fertility benefits or IVF treatments or IUI or whatever. And same-sex couples said, "Well, that's not fair because no amount of unprotected sex is going to give us a baby, but we want you to pay for our IVF treatment so we can manufacture a motherless and fatherless child." So all the different contours of the natural family that we have a biological relationship to our parents that we are gendered in our origins. We come from a man and a woman. Therefore we have a mother and a father that um only biology and adoption are legitimate ways to recognize parentage. All of those contours of natural family had to be erased in law. And now the only thing that exists in law is is the adult happy with the outcome? Has the adult gotten what they wanted? That means children are items to be acquired to any and every adult with the money and means to secure their contractual obligation, their contractual attachment to that adult. We have objectified children through gay marriage. So how do you fight that? Simply by forcing the law. Forcing the contours of the natural family to reemerge within law. Insisting on mothers and fathers. insisting on the importance of biology or adoption. Um, insisting that unrelated adults do not just get to walk over and claim a child. So, we are going to start to spread that child centric those natural contours of the family, we're going to start to allow that to ferment throughout the states. And then when that triggers a challenge, because it will, because you will have same-sex couples that say, "Hey, you can't privilege biology because we can never both be biologically related." We will say you are correct. That's because your relationship is really different from the relationship of a heterosexual couple that produces a child. And now the question won't be how do the adults identify? What is their backstory? Do they have dignity? The answer is the question will be do children need, deserve, and have a right to their own mother and father or is a stateassigned stranger just as good for them. So we're just going to change the whole terms of the conversation. I love it. I'm all about going back to uh bi biological reality here. Um, so you you mentioned a couple of specific you mentioned California and in your federalist article turning to this whole like public opinion and education because I think most people it's fair to say when they think about the legalization of same-sex marriage and the White House lighting up in rainbows. They saw it primarily as a civil rights issue for the adults at hand that this was we had discriminatory laws and we weren't letting love be love and all that. And at this point, it seems that public opinion is very much in favor of allowing same-sex marriage to continue as it is in law. Um, and so when it comes to starting to turn that tide, you're really talking about undoing decades of gay activism and sort of like conditioning the American people to see this as a civil rights issue. Um, now one story that you brought out in the Federalist article that is it it makes anyone pause. I think it should anyone of goodwill who's on any side of the conversation. You mentioned that California story where there were 21 surrogate born children to a couple. There was a legal mother. They shared the same father who happened to be the member of the Chinese Communist Party and was going to ship them back to China to raise them as Chinese American dual citizens. Um, it was just a bizarre story, but most bizarre of all is that it was completely legal under California law. And it seems to me that stories like this are a way of starting to make the public at least question if not be willing to go back on it. So that story, other stories. So my question is, when stories like that don't make national headlines and they kind of exist in our own information silos, how do you plan to break out of our information silo and get these shocking stories to the rest of the country? &gt;&gt; We knew that it was not enough to just try to change laws. We had to change public opinion. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And I think that you're right that a lot of people, if you just pulled somebody and said, "What do you think about gay marriage?" I think the majority of Americans would say, "I'm fine with it." But if you ask those same Americans, "Do children need a mother and father?" I think the vast majority would say, "Of course children need a mother and father. What are you even you smoking? What are you doing?" Like, yeah, duh. Like, it's so self-evident. We've all been there. So, our job in terms of changing public opinion is to directly connect gay marriage with child victimization and natural marriage with child protection. So, I've enlisted several incredible conservative influencers to be a part of our um coalition, our working group to change public opinion. Everyone from Llaya Rose to Michael Nolles to Ali Stucky and Abby Johnson, um Heidi St. John Josh Hammer, um the Babylon B guys, uh leaders from the Heritage Foundation, um lawyers, Jack Vobiaak, um you know, they're all in our coalition and their job is to change public opinion. We are going to start with conservatives because even conservatives are confused about this. We have seen a precipitous fall in support for gay marriage among Republicans, but I don't know if it's enough and I don't think it's for the right reasons. I think a lot of that is backlash against the tea in LGBT that overplayed their hand. &gt;&gt; I don't think even conservatives understand the direct connection between gay marriage and the commodification of children. So that's what we're going to do. We are going to re-educate. Right. You said exactly right. People have been conditioned to think about gay marriage as a civil right for adults. I was um before my ex account was hacked this morning. I was having very public um conversations and debates with Martina Narvatalovva. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who is a incredibly brave woman who was accusing me I mean I think she called me vile like four times over the last several days. &gt;&gt; The adjective of choice was vile. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. And she was saying you are taking away people's rights. &gt;&gt; And I said it is not me who has taken away rights. it is gay marriage that removes the rights of children to their mother and father. And I asked I said you know of the 38 countries that have legalized gay marriage. None of them have strengthened children's claim and recognition to be known and love by their own mother and father. All of them have have either completely obliterated it or significantly weakened that right. So that is I'm like you get to choose like do you want supposed gay rights or do you want legitimate natural child rights because those two things are incompatible. So we do need to change the way people think about this. I have thank goodness like glory to God seriously that I've got these incredible credible influential articulate influencers who are on our team that are going to help us make that case like a steady drum beat over the next few weeks and months and years. And when you do see a horrifying case, and they are endless, of people acquiring unrelated children, be they're he be they heterosexual or homosexual or CCP members or pedophiles, um or single or double or triple men, all of that is because of gay marriage. You can look at every single one and say gay marriage did that. Now, did the technology exist before gay marriage? Yes. Did the cultural conditioning of biology doesn't matter, love makes a family, did that exist before a burger? But what Oberfeld did is it fasttracked the acquisition of those children through those technologies and did it in the name of non-discrimination. So Oberfell has got to go. It has got to go. It is a direct injustice victimization of children. And until now, no organization in this country or the other 37 that have legalized gay marriage have even tried to roll it back. So that's what we're attempting to do. And we are actually so thankful that that Catholic vote is in this with us. &gt;&gt; Well, there's nowhere else to be when it comes to this issue. I mean, and that that kind of brings me to the question of faith. Um, obviously as Catholics, as evangelical Christian, u believing in scripture, it's it is so biblical to say children have to come first. And before I turn into that, I did just want to note too when it comes to cultural opinion, how how important images are, right? And I have I love your logo so much that it's it basically for those of you we're going to put it up on the screen, but for those of you who haven't seen it, we all know the human rights campaign equal sign, right? Like every Subaru here in Connecticut has it. And everyone knows the equal sign. But what you did was whoever designed this was brilliant. They took the equal sign, they made it into a greater than sign. Same color, same little font, but it was it's beautiful. And I think that that that's what we're talking about is that we can't talk about it's all about adult equity or equality etc. This is about children have to be greater than. Now that is a specifically Christian notion that &gt;&gt; the the blessed are the poor, blessed are the weak, blessed are the meek, that this the children um those who are least shall be greatest. Um and uh this to me this is so the heart of Christian practice and belief that from the earliest moments of the church the sign of Christianity taking over a culture and being adopted by the people of that culture has been that that the first generation is known for saving babies. They're known for taking babies off of trash heaps. They're known for pulling little girls who are being trained up in brothel out of the brothel. Right? That's what we are as Christians in every civilization in the world. But but speaking of that, the stats are pretty dismal for our churches on this issue of gay marriage. And I wanted to ask you why you think that is. I know we spoke about it in an early conversation, but it's so appropriate to that third prong of greater than. Um why that is and how we as Christians can start to talk to our brothers and sisters about this more effectively. I just want to say that was so beautifully put and that's a point that I make a lot that right down to the fabric of the origins of the church, we have been a child protective people because we follow a savior who did not arrive on the scene as an adult. He came as a one and two and three and four and five day old blastois and then an embryo and then an unborn baby and then a newborn and then a toddler and then a teenager. I mean he experienced every single stage, you know. He says if you want to be if you want to seek the kingdom of God, you have to become like one of these little ones. You know, he tells us there's corporal punishment that he himself will inflict on us if we cause one of these little ones to stumble. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yes. It is so imperative and it's written all over. I mean, like you said, like we have sort of these um these vague um guid guidelines that the weak are never supposed to sacrifice for the strong. It's always the strong that should sacrifice for the weak. And then they get, you know, God gets very explicit about caring for the fatherless and the orphaned over and over and over and over. And I think a lot of us read those verses like them, think what a good idea. &gt;&gt; But I don't think that we understand that what is happening in the world of marriage and family and reproductive technologies today completely green lit by things like Oberfeld, like rulings like Oberfell is the farthest thing from protecting the fatherless. It is manufacturing the fatherless. It is engineering the motherless. And so I think that the third expression of what we are trying to do is we want to turn the church into a child centric fighting force. And we've got incredible um Christian thinkers involved in that working group. Protestants like Dr. Mulber, Dr. Albert Mohler and John Stonereet. But we also have um a wonderful man named Matthew from Word on Fire who's been very very involved in you know developing these materials and suggesting other Catholics that can be involved in the creation of the videos. So I I pray that it's a beautiful split where we have evangelicals you know speaking and then Catholics speaking and all of us are going to use these materials together because we all have the same mandate. We have all expressed the same thing across different countries at different centuries. The threats against children have changed. It was exposure like you said in the first century. It has largely been abortion in every country that the church has existed. Sometimes it's sexual trafficking of children in the name of idol worship like Amy Carmichael, you know, confronted in India. Sometimes it's the threat of female genital mutilation in the Islamic world. Sometimes it's the footbinding of children in in you know 18th and 19th century China. The threats to children change. The church's response does not. The church always says we will piss off adults so that we protect children. And I think one reason why we are not seeing that kind of courage in the modern church is because well I won't speak for the Catholics. I'll speak for the evangelicals. I'll speak for the Protestants. Why aren't they speaking up? It is because they have oversimplified the message of Christ and the gospel and they've boiled it down to this vacuous saying, love God, love people. That's what we're all about. Love God, love people. Well, if by love you mean fullthroated truth and grace, fine. But that's not what you mean. You mean love God, love people, and avoid any kind of conflict or confrontation in the name of being welcoming to all kinds of adults because you want to win them for the gospel. Well, if that means that you are forsaking children, if you are forcing the weak to be victimized so that you can love God, love people, I have news for you. Wrong gospel, wrong God. So one thing that we are hoping to do with our materials for churches is to make it very very clear that God's plan A for child that child protection is a Christian concern. God's plan A for child protection is marriage that is permanent, complimentary, and monogous. And identify the we're going to have a Catholic do a very brief explanation of the church's teaching. We're going to have a Protestant do a quick biblical like look at this from the like creation story model. So nobody nobody has a theological out here. And then we're going to go through the sociological evidence talking about the goodness of Christ's definition of monogamy, permanence, and ex exclusivity and how each of those has a very specific child benefit. And then we are going to look biblically and historically at the Christians who have suffered greatly for the sake of protecting children. And we today will also suffer. We probably won't be jailed, but we will lose friends. You are going to be a social outcast. You might be, but you know what? Kids are worth it. And if you consider yourself a Christian, this is the time to step into the great cloud of witnesses of other believers that have gone before you and risked greatly and very often changed entire societies through the way they dignified children. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, that's a call that all Christians can get behind and be inspired by. I mean, like you said, we have such a great cloud of witnesses. I think of on the Catholic side, just the the paniply of saints who have put their lives on the line. Talk about losing your reputation uh to fight the slave trade, to fight um the most horrible instances of attacking children and that this is our time to do that here. That's right. &gt;&gt; And um Katie F, we're so we're so grateful to stand next to you as you take this on. I think after after Oberafel, we saw what the fallout would be for people who challenged the the ruling regime and an opinion on gay marriage so so-called um and that that the the vitriol of that backlash really did frighten a lot of Christians um of goodwill into the shadows. And now 10 years later, I mean, we have the receipts. We know what happened. We know what it did to children. and we got to come out of the shadows now and put our fear aside from whatever we might have experienced back then during the fight against gay marriage. So, time to pick it up, pick up the sword again. Thank you so much, Katie. Is there anything else you'd like to direct people to? Any particular resources or accounts to follow, get in this with us. We are fighting giants. And thank God we have this amazing coalition, this cross-section of Christians and conservatives and policy organizations that are in this with us. If you go to greater than campaign.com, go to the about page and just look at all the different people that are in this with us. And even since we started, we've probably had 15 others that are like, "Uh, hi, put me in. Like, I am ready to play a coach." Like people are I really think that the other side went too far and now we're not afraid anymore. We're like you've called us all the names. You've made all the threats. Like &gt;&gt; I get it. I'm vile. Yep. I'm totally Yeah. Yeah. But but it's like I think that a lot of us have said there is no amount of concessions that will ever make you happy or want to live at peace with us. So how about we just advocate for the truth regardless of what you call us. And we're in on this. So, we want you, if you're listening to this, get in on this with us. Go to greater than campaign.com, sign up, and get our newsletters. We will not spam you, but we will keep you posted on what's happening. We'll do our best to equip you because I think a lot of you are thinking, I I get it. I agree with you. I'm totally I know, but I don't know what to say to the lesbians living next door. I don't know what to do. Or maybe you're saying, "Yeah, but then people always say, I want to erase their existence." And I'm like, "I love you. I don't want to." Just come sign up. We will tell you how to have these kinds of conversations. We will make you fearless. Um, but be in this with us because especially as it relates to changing public opinion that does need to start from the grassroots and that is you people like you have a really important part to play here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Everyone has a heart to play especially since we are changing public opinion and the culture here. So again, I'm going to send everyone over to the greater than campaign.com website. Also challenge you to take the quiz on there. There's a fun little quiz. If you think you know what a burger was about and what it did to child law, like make sure you take that and just learn. I learned some new things there that I had no idea before. So definitely take the quiz and sign up for the newsletter. and Katie Fast. I am sure we will be in touch because this is a this is a marathon, not a sprint and we are in in it till the finish line. So, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me on and thank you so much for standing firm on behalf of kids with us.
