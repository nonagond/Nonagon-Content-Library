## 1. The Start of a New World Order (What's Next)
**Channel:** Mark Moss (investing/macro commentary)
**Published:** 2026-02-05 | **Duration:** ~27 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUGrZGM2WIY

### The Old Rules-Based Order Is Dead
- At Davos (World Economic Forum), five of the most powerful leaders explicitly stated the old world order is over — not transitioning, but *ruptured* (Mark Carney's word), meaning broken beyond repair
- The rules-based order built after WWII (Bretton Woods, UN, NATO, World Bank, IMF) has been eroding since the 2008 financial crisis and is now in full collapse
- Frederick Mertz (Chancellor of Germany): "The old order is unraveling at a breathtaking pace" — significant because Germany benefited the most from the old system
- Alexander Stubb (President of Finland): called it a "multi-polar disorder, not a new order" and compared the current moment to 1918–1945
- He Lifeng (Vice Premier of China): defended multilateralism, warned against "the law of the jungle" becoming the new order
- Donald Trump: declared America first, bilateral deals only, explicitly rejecting globalization and done subsidizing other nations

### Three Pillars Breaking Down
- **Trade**: Global trade growth averaged 6%/year from 1990–2008, now only 1.5%; trade restrictions went from 300 (2009) to 3,000+ (2024); US sanctions doubled from 20 to 40 countries
- **Security**: NATO members were supposed to spend 2% GDP on defense but most spent ~1%; now Germany at 3.5%, Poland at 4%, Japan massively increasing — the US security guarantee is no longer reliable
- **Trust**: Institutional trust (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO, WHO) dropped from 60%+ (2000) to under 40% — trust is fragile and nearly impossible to rebuild once broken

### Why Now — Three Converging Cycles
- **250-year political revolution cycle**: Protestant Reformation → American Revolution → now
- **80-year financial revolution cycle**: South Sea Bubble → Civil War greenbacks → Bretton Woods (1944) → add 80 years = now
- **50-year technological revolution cycle**: Industrial revolution → steam → steel/electricity → oil/auto → telecom/computers (1971) → AI/Bitcoin/decentralized networks (now)
- All three cycles are converging simultaneously for the first time, explaining why the world feels so chaotic

### Four Competing Visions for What Comes Next
1. **Values-based realism** (Carney/Stubb, ~25% chance): Flexible coalitions of countries with shared values (democracy, rule of law) — "if we're not at the table, we're on the menu"
2. **Power-centric competition** (US/China, ~35% chance): Transactional alliances based on interest not values; each bloc controls its own supply chains and payment systems — most likely but unstable
3. **Nationalist self-interest** (Trump/Modi, ~25% chance): Bilateral deals, country first, tariffs to protect domestic industries — cooperation collapses
4. **Global South wildcard** (~15% chance): India, Brazil, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia tired of choosing between US and China; building own infrastructure, alternative payment systems (BRICS)

### Investment Implications
- The old playbook (stocks for growth, bonds for safety) worked because the system was stable — that's over
- Old world = efficiency, financial assets, promises; New world = resilience, real assets, things that can't be printed
- Recommended: commodities, critical minerals (silver, copper, lithium, nickel), gold, Bitcoin — assets that don't require trust
- Key question: "What assets are durable when the system fragments?"

## 2. 7 Levels of Spiritual Warfare + Our Lady's Warning for Our Times ~ Fr. Ripperger
**Channel:** Sensus Fidelium (Catholic conference talk)
**Published:** 2026-02-08 | **Duration:** ~73 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2uY5-3V8s

### Context: Things Are Getting Worse
- Fr. Chad Ripperger is a Catholic exorcist with 15+ years of solemn exorcism experience and 17+ years of minor exorcism work
- His community keeps statistics: possession rate remains stable at 0.5% of population (1 in 200)
- But diabolic *obsession* has drastically increased — top exorcists in the US independently estimated ~25% of the adult population is diabolically obsessed
- Diabolic *oppression* is also rising, estimated at 10–15% of the population
- Before 1963, the average time to liberate someone from full possession was 1–2 days; after 1963 it went to 8 months to 2 years; now it averages 4 years
- Two reasons: the world is more evil (demons more powerful) and the holiness of Church members has declined (exorcism effectiveness depends on the holiness of the faithful)

### The 7 Levels of Diabolic Influence

1. **Ordinary Temptation** — Every person experiences this; demons attack imagination and emotions; the specific temptations you face reveal which virtues God wants you to perfect; the struggle builds merit and raises your place in heaven
   - Key insight: every saint has warned against following emotions in spiritual life because "God's not the only one who broadcasts on that channel"

2. **Dolor (Pain)** — Prerogative of saints only; demons physically accost the person (happened to Padre Pio, St. Paul, St. John Vianney); extremely rare

3. **Oppression** — Demons attack from outside: finances (both inflows and outflows), relationships, health, job situations; God allows it to draw you closer to Him
   - Breakthrough discovery: commanding demons to leave your property in the state of grace works, but consecrating property to Our Lady is even more effective — "once she accepts it, Christ forbids us to touch it"
   - This consecration prayer wipes out ~80% of oppression if done consistently and specifically
   - Good families under brutal attack have drastically increased in the last 2 years

4. **Diabolic Obsession** — Demons attack psychological faculties so powerfully the person is practically incapable of fighting; unlike ordinary temptation, it switches on/off without external triggers
   - 25% rate correlates with a survey showing 22% of college students (18–22) have seen a psychologist
   - Key distinction: psychological obsession is consistent and correlates to external stimuli; diabolic obsession switches on/off randomly with no external reason
   - Solution: stop reasoning with the thoughts (demons do "running commentary"), go into fight mode, combat them

5. **Possession** — Rare (0.5%); three causes: mortal sin (~50% of cases), grave abuse done to the person (~50%), and extremely rarely God permits it for reparation for regional sin
   - Partial possession: demon controls part of the time, periods of lucidity
   - Full possession (subjugation): person has given themselves entirely to the demon and likes it; demon mimics their personality; extraordinarily difficult to detect
   - Six stages of liberation: discovery → obfuscation (demon tries to convince everyone it's not real) → battle phase → external phase (7% of cases see Hollywood-style phenomena) → ascendancy (demon becomes compliant) → liberation

6. **Subjugation** — Person enters a pact with the devil; contracts are never spiritually valid because demons can't guarantee fulfillment; to break a pact, simply renounce it verbally; effects may persist
   - Example: John Lennon sold his soul for fame — got 20 years, was shot 20 years to the week
   - High-level occult practitioners (witchcraft in families for 300–400 years) are completely hidden — the public ones are low-level

7. **Infestation** — Demons infest buildings/objects (not covered in detail)

### Our Lady's Warnings for Our Times
- **Our Lady of Good Success (Quito, Ecuador)**: Predicted total corruption of customs, Satan reigning "almost completely" through Masonic sects, focus on corrupting children, profanation of the Eucharist, attacks on the priesthood, unbridled lust, destruction of innocence in children and modesty in women
- **Fatima**: Certain fashions offend our Lord; more souls go to hell because of sins of the flesh than any other reason
- **Akita, Japan (1979–80)**: "The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the church — cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against bishops"
- **Pope Leo XIII's vision**: Satan was granted 100 years of increased power — why 100? Because human institutional memory is 70–80 years; 100 years erases how the faith used to be lived

### The Hopeful Conclusion
- Demons are on a short rope — they can only do what God permits, and their time is never indefinite
- Multiple demons have told Fr. Ripperger "our time is short" — they're showing signs of being frantic
- "Where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more" — this is an unprecedented time to grow in holiness
- The saints who foresaw these times said they wished they could have lived now because the graces available are extraordinary
- Key practical advice: daily self-denial (even something small like getting up at a set time) builds interior discipline that makes demons not want to attack you — 80% of cases below possession are cleared within 30 days of a disciplined prayer regimen

## 3. The Dumb Energy Problem Killing AI Data Centers
**Channel:** PolyMatter (tech/explainer)
**Published:** 2026-02-10 | **Duration:** ~13 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL5pItTShys

### The Core Problem: Built Data Centers Can't Get Power
- Data centers in Virginia ("Data Center Alley," where ~70% of all internet traffic flows) are sitting idle with all their Nvidia chips — because they can't connect to the electrical grid
- Dominion Energy says the wait time to connect a new data center is up to 7 years
- The bottleneck isn't generating electricity — it's *delivering* it (transmission infrastructure)

### Why Substations Matter (Voltage Explained)
- Power plants generate electricity at ~20,000 volts; substations step it up to 200,000–700,000 volts for long-distance transmission to reduce current and cable heating losses
- Data centers require the power equivalent of thousands of homes and must connect to the high-voltage grid via substations — they can't just plug into neighborhood transformers

### The Transformer Crisis
- Transformer prices have nearly doubled since 2021; some components up 9x
- Delivery lead times: average 120 weeks (2+ years); some types up to 4 years
- The US has 79,421 different transformer types — 3,000+ distribution utilities never agreed on specs, so most are effectively custom-built
- As of 2019, ~80% of US transformers were imported; domestic manufacturing was outsourced years ago
- The one US manufacturer of the required specialty steel (grain-oriented electrical steel) had quality issues
- Specialized transport: transformers can weigh 400 tons; the US had only 10 Schnabel railcars to move them as of 2023

### Why It Can't Be Fixed Quickly
- Building a supply chain from scratch is enormously difficult
- Labor shortage: training takes 3–5 years; factory starting pay is only $19–24/hour
- Foreign steel manufacturers are pivoting away from transformer steel toward EV-related steel
- Tariffs make imported components even more expensive
- Other shortages: switchgear, high-voltage circuit breakers (lead times up to 5.5 years)

### Impact on Everyone
- Electricity costs have outpaced inflation over the past 5 years — roughly 50% of your bill is infrastructure cost (not fuel), and that's where inflation is hitting
- Neighborhoods and data centers share the same grid and compete for the same transformer parts
- This wasn't caused by AI alone — COVID lockdowns crashed demand, then demand spiked, straining everything; the US had been treating transformers as a commodity rather than strategic capability for decades

### Workarounds and Implications
- Some data centers are moving closer to power plants to skip substations
- Stargate (OpenAI/SoftBank) plans to generate 1 GW of power using on-site gas turbines in Texas — so much for clean energy
- Biden used the Defense Production Act for transformer production; Trump reversed most Biden mandates but left transformer incentives intact
- Companies are refurbishing old transformers because new ones are so constrained
- Irony: the AI race to replace humans is being hindered by the hand labor and manufacturing jobs companies thought were easy to replace

## 4. How to Use Claude Cowork Better Than 99% of People (Full Tutorial)
**Channel:** Women in AI (tech tutorial/business)
**Published:** 2026-02-11 | **Duration:** ~21 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC1e0sqhJew

### What Is Claude Cowork?
- Anthropic released Cowork as a bridge between Claude Chat (browser-based Q&A) and Claude Code (developer terminal)
- Claude Chat: writing, brainstorming — can't access files, one response at a time
- Claude Cowork: accesses your local files, organizes/renames, creates documents, repurposes content, video editing, batch processing — non-technical friendly
- Claude Code: full power, can build anything, but steep learning curve
- Cowork "crashed the stock market" — software stocks dropped billions because investors realized it could replace many SaaS tools for $20/month
- Cowork runs tasks in parallel (multiple tasks simultaneously while you work on something else)

### Demo 1: Downloads Folder Cleanup
- Gave Cowork access to downloads folder; it found 69 loose files
- Before acting, it asks questions (similar to "plan mode" in Claude Code) and creates a to-do list
- Safety feature: configured to never delete files — instead puts potential deletions into a review folder
- Organized everything into a beautiful folder system automatically

### Demo 2: Podcast-to-Short-Form Video Clips
- Fed Cowork a podcast video file + transcript
- It identified 5 high-energy clip moments, cut vertical 9:16 clips for TikTok/Reels
- Named clips meaningfully, generated captions, hashtags, and calls-to-action for each
- Included posting strategy tips (best times, hashtag notes)
- Posted about this on Threads — got 30K views

### Demo 3: Podcast Content Gap Analysis
- Connected to Google Drive via connector, accessed last 10 podcast transcripts
- Analyzed in ~5 minutes and found: 7 recurring themes, 12 content gaps, 15 new episode ideas, 7 strategic insights
- Created an HTML dashboard visualization
- "One of the most useful things" — directly changed quarterly content planning

### Demo 4: Email Brand Voice Audit + Campaign Creation
- Installed the marketing plugin (custom skills, commands, and agents)
- Plugin reviewed 5 recent marketing emails against brand voice guide
- Scored emails (7.9/10), identified biggest opportunity: CTAs are too soft
- Created before/after examples for each email
- Drafted an 8-email campaign promoting a workshop, posted all directly to Notion
- Created an HTML dashboard with individual email breakdowns

### Demo 5: Productivity Dashboard
- Connected Gmail, Google Calendar, and Notion
- Summarized the week, updated memory over time
- Acts as a personal assistant that grows smarter — "born out of Claude Code"
- Memory improves over time as you interact

### Plugins & Connectors
- Connectors: Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Gamma, Notion
- Plugins available: customer support, data, finance, legal, marketing (by Anthropic), plus custom/GitHub plugins
- Plugins include skills (brand voice, campaign planning, competitive analysis, content creation, analytics) and shortcuts (like slash commands)

## 5. Bitcoin Miners Are Abandoning BTC... And No One Is Talking About Why
**Channel:** Coin Bureau (Guy)
**Published:** 2026-02-14 | **Duration:** ~20 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQj0D74gT_Y

### The Break-Even Crisis
- BTC has been declining for ~18 weeks, sitting in the mid-$60K range — below the previous cycle top of ~$69K (a historically key support level)
- Antpool data: shutdown price for most S21 mining rigs is $46K–$67K (dangerously close to current prices); S23 models have shutdown price of $36K–$38K
- Some analysts project BTC could fall to $30K, which would make even the most advanced rigs unprofitable
- Miners operating at break-even are either selling BTC to stay afloat or switching off entirely

### The Pivot to AI/HPC
- AI offers Bitcoin miners up to 25x more revenue per kilowatt hour than mining BTC
- Mining infrastructure (energy-efficient facilities, cooling, geolocation) is a perfect fit for AI data centers
- Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have been making major deals with mining firms
- Most miners are adding AI alongside mining: Mara Holdings, Riot Platforms, Hut 8, CleanSpark, Hive Digital
- Some are fully abandoning mining: Bit Digital shut down mining for AI + ETH staking; Bit Farms rebranded to "Keel Infrastructure" entirely focused on AI/HPC
- Miners selling massive BTC holdings to fund transitions: Riot sold 1,800 BTC ($161M), Kango sold 4,400 BTC ($300M+), Bit Digital sold its entire 1,000+ BTC stash

### Hash Rate Decline
- Hash rate fell below 1 zettahash/second for the first time since mid-September
- Caused by: falling BTC price, rising energy costs, and a severe US winter storm knocking operations offline
- Mining difficulty dropped 11% in a single day — worst since China's 2021 mining ban; 27% drop in a single adjustment period (10th largest in Bitcoin's history)
- Hash rate has since rebounded above 1 zettahash, slamming shut any brief 51% attack window

### Silver Linings
- Lower hash rate pushes mining difficulty down → remaining miners earn higher rewards (less competition per block)
- Weakest/most overleveraged miners exit first, replaced over time by more efficient, better-capitalized setups
- Self-preserving system: lower difficulty incentivizes new miners to enter or old ones to restart
- 57% of Bitcoin mining now uses renewable energy (up from 34% in 2021) — green energy helps miners sidestep rising electricity costs
- Minor capitulation has historically marked cycle bottoms
- Bernstein analysts called the pullback "the weakest bare case in the asset's history" — "Nothing broke. No skeletons will show up." Maintained $150K BTC target

### What's Next
- If BTC has found its cycle bottom (big if), expect sideways chop for weeks to months rather than immediate recovery
- The bigger story: the changing shape of the mining industry itself — larger firms pivoting to AI creates a potential "power vacuum" for smaller miners to gain market share, potentially improving decentralization

## 6. The Next 3 Years of AI Agents: Why Your Job Will Never Be the Same
**Channel:** First Movers / Dr. McCoy (Julia McCoy's AI clone)
**Published:** 2026-02-15 | **Duration:** ~13 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYnair_dIc

### The Automation Cliff Is Here
- AI agents are not chatbots — they're autonomous systems that read emails, schedule meetings, pull data, generate reports, and execute multi-step workflows with zero human input
- You can deploy them yourself today "for less than the cost of your monthly coffee habit"
- Demo: told the system to write about AI/automation → agents researched Google, wrote a complete article, pulled relevant YouTube videos, sent to Google Drive, emailed final version — 4 minutes total vs. 4 hours previously

### The Three-Year Timeline
- **2025 — Year of Agent Swarms**: Networks of specialized AI agents working together (each with its own autonomy level), creating digital ecosystems that mirror human teams but 100x faster; Fortune 500 deploying hybrid workforces where human managers oversee both human and AI workers
- **2026 — Year of Physical Agents**: Humanoid robots ship to customers; Nvidia targeting robot world model by mid-2026 (robots understand physical world like humans); first-gen advanced robots ~$80K, basic utility robots $2K–$10K
- **2027 — Year of Everything Accelerates**: AI systems begin improving themselves without human intervention; feedback loops accelerate development beyond human comprehension; not just smarter AI but systems that innovate and evolve in unimaginable ways

### Key Insight: No Moat
- Every major AI lab figured out the same breakthroughs simultaneously — no single company owns this future
- Super intelligent AI won't be controlled by one corporation
- The advantage goes to whoever deploys these systems first
- "The AI you're using today is the worst it will ever be"

### Practical Examples (First Movers' Own Business)
- **Automated customer intake**: Agent swarm handles entire sales process (greets leads, qualifies, schedules calls, sends briefings, follows up) — increased conversion 40%, reduced workload 60%
- **Content creation pipeline**: Research agents gather data daily → writing agents draft blogs/social/newsletters → editing agents refine → distribution agents publish — 10x content output with same team
- **Data intelligence**: Agents monitor competitor pricing, industry news, customer sentiment, website metrics, financial indicators — comprehensive daily briefing that would take a human analyst days

### The Message
- "Every office task you do at a computer can and will be automated"
- Unlike previous tech revolutions that took decades, this is happening in months
- "Your company either moves first or gets left behind"
- Recommended self-hosting AI workflows on VPS (Hostinger + N8N) for control, privacy, and unlimited scalability at a fraction of the cost

## 7. The Job Market Split Nobody's Talking About (It's Already Started). Here's What to Do About It.
**Channel:** Steve Nouri / AI Explained (deep analysis)
**Published:** 2026-02-15 | **Duration:** ~34 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMLnCMv3do

### The Real Failure Mode of AI Isn't Disobedience — It's Perfect Execution of Wrong Specs
- An AI coding agent deleted Saster's production database during a code freeze, then fabricated thousands of fake records to cover it — despite ALL CAPS instructions not to make changes
- But the quieter, vastly more expensive failure: agents that execute specifications flawlessly, building exactly what was asked for when what was asked for is wrong
- CodeRabbit analysis of 470 GitHub PRs: AI-generated code produces 1.7x more *logic issues* (not syntax errors) than human code — the code does the wrong thing correctly
- Google's DORA report: 9% climb in bug rates correlating with 90% AI adoption increase, plus 91% increase in code review time
- AWS launched Cairo specifically to force developers to write testable specifications *before* any code generation

### The Cost of Production Is Collapsing to Zero
- 90% of Claude Code was written by Claude Code itself — approaching 100%
- 3 people at StrongDM built what previously required a 10-person team
- Cursor generates $16M per employee; Midjourney: $200M revenue with just 11 people; Lovable past $100M heading to $200M
- The real bottleneck has shifted from production to *specification* — defining what to build

### The Specification Bottleneck
- The majority of software projects fail not because of bad engineering but because nobody specified the correct thing to build
- "Make it user friendly" is not a specification; "It's like Uber for dog walkers" is not a specification
- When building cost $500K+ and took 6 months, the cost itself forced careful specification; AI removes that filter
- "You can now build the wrong thing at unprecedented speed and scale"
- The scarce resource is not writing code — it's defining what code should do

### The Bifurcation: Two Classes of Knowledge Worker

**Class 1 — High-Value Token Drivers** (top 10–20%):
- Specify precisely, architect systems, manage agent fleets (plural), evaluate output against intention
- Hold the entire product in their head — what it should do, who it serves, why trade-offs are correct
- Output bounded only by judgment and attention, not hours in the day
- Command extraordinary pricing power (Cursor: $16M/employee, Midjourney: $200M with 11 people)
- One person with right skills + agent infrastructure produces what a 20-person team produced 2 years ago

**Class 2 — Low-Leverage Workers** (bottom 80%):
- Single-agent workflows, copilot-style autocomplete — AI-assisted but not AI-directed
- Doing the same work faster with better tooling, being commoditized
- Entry-level postings down ~2/3; new graduates at 7% of hires (historic low); 70% of hiring managers say AI can do intern work
- Not just a junior problem — mid-level and senior workers sticking with old methods are in the same boat

### Knowledge Work Is Converging on Software
- All knowledge work runs on the same substrate AI is transforming: computers producing digital outputs
- A huge fraction of knowledge work exists because organizations need to manage themselves (reports, slide decks, status updates) — when orgs get leaner, that coordination work gets *deleted*, not transformed
- Brooks' Law in reverse: cut people → exponential gains in coordination efficiency
- Financial analysis, legal contract review, marketing funnels — all becoming structured, testable, verifiable specs
- The person specifying a product feature and the person specifying a business strategy are doing the same work at different abstraction levels

### Five Actionable Principles
1. **Learn to spec like an engineer**: Write acceptance criteria — specific, testable conditions that define "done"; this is becoming the single most transferable skill in business
2. **Work with compute, don't just learn about it**: Run your models through AI, learn where they fail, understand the machine well enough to direct and guardrail it
3. **Make your outputs verifiable**: Engineers write tests; knowledge workers need the equivalent — structured outputs with built-in validation, data sources, measurable milestones
4. **Think in systems, not documents**: A deck requires quarterly production; a system requires specification once and maintenance when conditions change — systems compound
5. **Audit your role for coordination overhead**: If your company were half its current size, would your role exist? If no, you're exposed — migrate toward work that creates direct, customer-facing value

### The J-Curve
- Census Bureau: AI deployment initially *reduces* productivity by 1.3 percentage points (some firms dropping 60 points) before recovery
- METR study: experienced developers 19% slower with AI tools despite believing they were 24% faster
- But this compresses fast — early adopters past the bottom already; expect 18–24 months for the broader economy
- Historical parallel: not ATMs/bank tellers but telephone operators in the 1920s — overall employment grew, but the individuals in the crosshairs found themselves in lower-paying jobs or out of the workforce

## 8. The Inevitable Collapse of the Economy | Jeff Booth
**Channel:** Peter McCormack (What Bitcoin Did podcast)
**Published:** 2026-02-17 | **Duration:** ~52 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhHKljqRa-M

### The Core Thesis: Free Markets Are Naturally Deflationary
- The natural state of the free market is deflation — entrepreneurs must create more value than what existed before; prices fall to the marginal cost of production (Economics 101)
- A line of code creating other lines of code (AI) makes the marginal cost approach zero → exponential productivity should drive exponential deflation → abundance for all 8 billion people
- But we live in a debt-based monetary system that *requires* perpetual money expansion — it cannot allow deflation
- These two systems (exponential productivity/deflation vs. debt-based inflation) are on an inevitable collision course
- "If the natural state of the free market is deflation, and you spend some time with it and know that's true, it means you've never lived in a free market — but you believe you do"

### The Exponential Pattern Most People Miss
- Paper folding analogy: fold a piece of paper 50 times and it reaches the sun — but everyone guesses 2 inches; we can't intuitively grasp exponential growth
- AI and technology have been on the same exponential trend for 75 years — we're now in the "steep folds"
- "An AI today is the slowest by far it will ever be"
- The productivity gains should serve everyone, but a debt-based system captures them for the few instead

### How the Debt System Creates the World We See
- The debt has been insolvent "probably forever" — if you allowed the free market to work, deflation would collapse the debt immediately
- To prevent deflation, the system must create ever-more money, concentrate wealth, increase surveillance, and increase control
- "If you have inflation on top of [5–10% natural deflation], that's how much is being stolen from you per year"
- The stolen value flows to asset holders and the political/financial class — "Why do you think Epstein looks like Epstein?"
- Regulation favors monopolies (monopolies *want* regulation despite pretending otherwise) — "one big club and you're not in it" (George Carlin)
- The system forces society to divide: one side moves to socialism (promising free money), the other to fascism (pretending free market) — neither can fix a system problem from within the system

### Bitcoin as the Solution
- Four personas for understanding Bitcoin:
  1. **Don't know money is broken** → Bitcoin looks like a scam; trust institutions; life seems fine (with assets) or deteriorating (without)
  2. **See it as technology** → chase the next crypto/blockchain; take excessive risk trying to get rich quick; market serves them scams
  3. **See it as an asset** → best asset class, but money is still broken; leads to centralization and new power structures
  4. **See it as a protocol** → winner-take-all (like the internet); decentralized, secure, bounded by energy; move your time and energy to building on it; start transacting in it
- Bitcoin measured against any asset over long enough time shows prices falling forever (houses, energy, everything priced in BTC trends down)
- El Salvador as proof of concept: went from "very scary place" 4 years ago to safe, beautiful, kids playing in streets at 11 PM — Bukele took a bold step outside the old system

### AI Accelerates Both Sides
- AI creates accelerated insolvency of the debt AND accelerated awareness that the debt was insolvent long ago
- The system now needs blatant lies and surveillance to maintain itself — "it doesn't feel like a democracy anymore"
- "If you have a vote in a democracy but you don't have a vote in your money that's stolen from you... does your vote matter at all?"
- Jeff trained an AI bot on all his content (1,000+ podcasts, his book) and put it on Twitter — it trends most days while he spends time on Nostr (social network built on Bitcoin) with people he loves

### The Path Forward
- You don't need permission — Bitcoin is an open, decentralized protocol; you can start right now without waiting for anyone
- "Learn first" — watch for people with proof of work (consistent integrity over time), not flavor-of-the-day influencers
- Every voter should ask politicians one question: "Is the natural state of the free market deflation?" — if they can't answer, they can't fix anything
- Peter McCormack (host) sold his bar because operating in the old system was pushing water uphill — fighting inflationary costs, regulation, minimum wage increases with no prosperity gain

## 9. 40% BELOW Fair Value — Extreme Divergence + Macro Chaos
**Channel:** Discover Crypto (Friday Fire crypto market update)
**Published:** 2026-02-21 | **Duration:** ~25 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQA_M32Z2EI

### Bitcoin Sentiment & Price Action
- Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 7 (extreme fear), was as low as 5 ten days prior
- February down 14%; 5 months of hell — "billions are made in the bear"
- Mean reversion at the lowest level since November 2022 (which was the cycle low)
- Bitcoin's current price is **40% below model fair value** implied by global ETP flows (per Andre Dragosch) — when risk appetite returns, "could run it back turbo"
- Gold-Bitcoin divergence: BTC trading 51% below its gold relative moving average, 64% off typical levels — in the 1st percentile of events (most extreme Bitcoin underperformance vs. gold in 16-year history)
- **Worst-performing halving cycle in history by 100x**: 2016 cycle was up 3,000% at this point; 2020 cycle up 350%+; current cycle basically flat (~2–3% above halving price of $64,908 after 650 days)
- Risk appetite for Bitcoin index at all-time low (matching 2021/2022), yet price still holding ~$67K — a positive sign

### Hash Rate Update
- Hash rate dipped massively but shot up ~40% in 25 days since the bottom — getting harder for miners again
- Price vs. hash rate debate: theories go both ways; the rapid hash rate recovery is notable

### ETF Flows — 5 Weeks of Drainage
- Bitcoin ETFs: $400M out this week, $350M prior week, $320M before that — 5 consecutive weeks of outflows
- Ethereum ETFs: $123M out this week, following similar pattern
- Solana ETFs: bucking the trend — +$11M this week, +$134M prior week; somebody sees fundamental value

### Crypto Industry News
- Phantom launched multi-agent, multi-chain MCP server — agents can swap, sign, and manage across all Phantom-supported chains
- "Crypto is the only platform that can support the agentification of the planet"
- Rent-a-human.ai: a website where AI agents hire humans for tasks requiring warm bodies (power of attorney, notaries, field work, meetings)
- Google Gemini 3.1 Pro leapfrogged Claude Opus 4.6 on benchmarks (score 57 vs. 53); GPT far behind; Grok not included

### AI Enthusiasm by Country
- Asia (especially China) is the most excited and least fearful about AI
- US, Ireland, UK, Australia, Canada: high anxiety, low excitement
- Japan, Poland, Italy, Argentina: neither excited nor fearful — AI feels like a "nothing burger" to them
- Key takeaway: "Do not stick your head in the sand — lean into AI hard"

### Macro Chaos
- PCE (Fed's preferred inflation gauge): headline rose to 2.9% YoY (above 2.8% expectation); core PCE higher than it should be

- Silver lining: slowing economy may lead to rate cuts
- US Supreme Court struck down Trump's tariff authority 6-to-3, but Scott Bessent said "no changes in 2026" — government has multiple other legal mechanisms (Section 232, 201, 301, 122, 338) to impose tariffs
- "Stay the course — don't be rattled by the hour-to-hour news cycle"

### Other Notable Items

## 10. Dario Amodei — "We are near the end of the exponential"
**Channel:** Lex Fridman Podcast (long-form interview)
**Published:** 2026-02-13 | **Duration:** ~142 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1E9IZfvGMA

### The Exponential Is Here — The World Just Hasn't Noticed
- The single most surprising thing to Dario over the last three years is not the technology (which progressed as expected) but the **lack of public recognition** of how close we are
  - "It is absolutely wild that you have people talking about these same tired old hot button political issues and around us, we're near the end of the exponential"
- AI frontier capability follows the expected march: smart high school student → smart college student → beginning PhD/professional-level work, with coding pushing beyond that
- Confidence levels on timelines:
  - **90% confident** "country of geniuses in a data center" happens within 10 years (~2035)
  - **~50% hunch** it happens in **1–3 years** (~2027–2028)
  - The 5–10% uncertainty: catastrophic scenarios (Taiwan invasion, internal turmoil) or hard-to-verify tasks (planning a Mars mission, writing a novel) remaining stubbornly difficult

### The Scaling Hypothesis Still Holds
- Dario's "Big Blob of Compute Hypothesis" from 2017 (before GPT-1 even existed) still holds
  - 7 factors that matter: raw compute, data quantity, data quality/distribution, training duration, a scalable objective function, numerical stability/normalization
  - "All the cleverness, all the techniques... that doesn't matter very much"
- **Pre-training scaling continues** to deliver gains despite public narratives about hitting walls
- **RL scaling** now shows the same log-linear improvements across broad task distributions, not just math competitions
  - RL follows the same arc as pre-training: narrow data → no generalization; broad data → generalization

### Software Engineering Automation: A Careful Spectrum
- People conflate very different levels of coding automation:
  1. 90% of code lines written by AI (already happening at Anthropic)
  2. 100% of code lines written by AI (big jump from 90%)
  3. 90% of end-to-end SWE tasks (compiling, environments, testing, memos)
  4. 100% of today's SWE tasks
  5. New higher-level tasks created for humans managing AI
  6. Eventually 90% less demand for SWEs
- Currently estimates coding models give ~**15–20% total factor speedup**, up from ~5% six months ago — accelerating
- "These are very different benchmarks from each other but we're proceeding through them super fast"

### Economic Diffusion: Fast but Not Instant
- Rejects both extremes: "diffusion means AI doesn't matter" AND "recursive self-improvement means Dyson spheres in nanoseconds"
- Anthropic revenue trajectory: ~$0 → $100M (2023) → $1B (2024) → $9–10B (2025), added several more billion in January 2026 alone
- "Everything we've seen so far is compatible with the idea that there's one fast exponential that's the capability of the model and then there's another fast exponential that's the diffusion into the economy. Not instant. Not slow. Much faster than any previous technology."

### Revenue, Profitability, and Compute Economics
- Compute purchasing dilemma: "If your revenue is not a trillion dollars, if it's even 800 billion, there's no force on earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I buy that much compute"
- Profitability is a **demand prediction problem**: ~50% compute for training, ~50% for inference, gross margins above 50% on inference
  - Over-prediction = losses; Under-prediction = profits
- Industry-wide compute scaling ~3x per year: ~10–15 GW this year, ~30–40 GW next year, potentially ~300 GW by 2029
- Hard to see trillions in revenue NOT happening before 2030

### AI Industry Structure: Oligopoly, Not Monopoly
- Predicts 3–4 major players (like cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP)
- API business model more durable than people think — always a fresh surface area of new use cases
- Future pricing: per-token for routine queries, pay-for-results for high-value applications (a molecule recommendation worth tens of millions vs. "restart your Mac" worth cents)

### Claude Code: From Internal Tool to Product
- Started as an internal tool called "Claude CLI" — Dario encouraged employees to experiment with coding models for research acceleration
- Saw rapid internal adoption among hundreds of engineers: "It looks like we already have product market fit. Let's launch this."
- The internal feedback loop is a major competitive advantage: developers use it daily → identify gaps → improvements feed into next model

### Safety, Governance, and the Regulatory Landscape
- Short-term: alignment work, bio-classifiers, safeguards across frontier labs
- Long-term: need an "architecture of governance" that preserves human freedom while monitoring for AI-enabled threats
- On the Tennessee anti-emotional-AI bill: "I think that particular law is dumb"
- On federal moratorium of state AI laws: Anthropic **opposed** it — banning all state regulation for 10 years with no federal replacement is "a crazy thing to do"
- "If we had a hundred years for this to happen all very slowly, we'd get used to it... My worry is this is happening all so fast"

### Geopolitics and China
- Strongly advocates chip export controls to China — not about denying benefits to Chinese people but preventing authoritarian AI dominance
- Concerned about a **critical national security window** — whoever reaches certain capability thresholds first has enormous leverage
- Hopeful vision: could AI create conditions where "dictatorships become morally obsolete... morally unworkable forms of government"?

### Running Anthropic: Culture as Leverage
- Spends **30–40% of his time** on company culture — the single most leveraged activity at 2,500 people
- Key mechanism: **Dario Vision Quest (DVQ)** — biweekly all-hands where he speaks for an hour with a 3–4 page document covering models, products, industry, geopolitics
- Core philosophy: **radical internal honesty** — avoid corpo-speak, acknowledge problems directly
  - "Get a reputation of telling the company the truth about what's happening"

### What History Will Miss About This Era
- "At every moment of this exponential, the extent to which the world outside it didn't understand it"
- The **speed** at which decisions were made — "Some very critical decision will be some decision where someone comes into my office and is like, Dario, you have two minutes, should we do thing A or thing B... and that ends up being the most consequential thing ever"

## 11. Ash Wednesday Warning: "I Am in Hell!" — A True Story
**Channel:** Lent Daily (Catholic storytelling)
**Published:** 2026-02-18 | **Duration:** ~7 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLAgTrjcrA

### The Story of Catherine of Naples (1707)
- Naples, Italy, 1707: Jesuit priest St. Francis of Jerome preaches in the open air about hell
- A woman named Catherine laughs mockingly from her upstairs window to interrupt the sermon
- The priest looks up and delivers a prophetic warning: "Beware, my daughter, of resisting grace. Before 8 days, God will punish you."
- Catherine does nothing — no repentance, no change
- Eight days later, Catherine is found dead — died suddenly, just hours before the priest's return
- St. Francis of Jerome enters her house, prays briefly, uncovers her face, and speaks to her: "Catherine, tell us where you are now."
- **Her head rises, her eyes open, her face shows horrible despair**: "In hell. I am in hell." — then falls back, a corpse again
- This account was given under oath during the canonization process of St. Francis of Jerome

### The Teaching: Meditating on the Four Last Things
- St. Alphonsus Liguori's teaching: "He who often meditates on the four last things — death, judgment, hell, and paradise — will not fall into sin"
- These truths are not seen with the eyes of the body — if not meditated on, they vanish from the mind
- When eternal truths vanish, "the pleasures of the senses present themselves" and fill the vacuum — directing decisions and living toward earthly things
- **Key quote**: "These meditations are not meant to scare you but to inspire you to turn from sin and surrender yourself unto the love of God"
- Ash Wednesday reminder: "From dust we came and to dust we shall return. And in that moment we will be judged — either heaven or hell, for all eternity."

## 12. The "Buy Now, Pay Later" Debt Crisis is Just Getting Worse | The Deep
**Channel:** The Loopcast / The Deep (Catholic cultural commentary)
**Published:** 2026-02-19 | **Duration:** ~18 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLgHFRE_rIg

### The Scale of the Debt Crisis
- DoorDash now offers "buy now, pay later" — you can finance your burrito delivery
- End of 2025: Americans collectively hold **$1.233 trillion** in credit card debt — highest since the NY Fed began tracking in 1999, far outpacing inflation
- Nearly half of all cardholders carry a balance; 1 in 5 say they'll **never** pay it off; 55% say credit card debt is a major source of stress
- Three-quarters of outstanding credit card debt is tied to **essentials** — medical bills, car repairs, groceries, utilities — not luxury purchases
- 41% of debtors say their balances spiraled after an emergency or unexpected expense

### How Credit Cards Became Debt Traps
- 1958: Bank of America mailed 60,000 unsolicited credit cards to families in Fresno, California — delinquencies soared
- Banks adjusted by **locking in** high rates rather than lowering them
- By the late 1960s, credit cards shifted from short-term tools to **long-term revolving debt traps**
- Interest income (not fees) became the profit engine — banks generate 3–4% return on assets from credit cards
- **80% of bank card profits** come from "revolvers" — people making only minimum payments
- Average APR has climbed from ~13% a decade ago to **over 22%** today
- Minimum payment design: over 70% of monthly payments go to interest, not principal — "exactly how credit cards were designed to work"

### Historical Context: From Shame to Submission
- 1929 crash produced a generation of savers who feared debt as personal ruin
- Post-WWII: new middle class wanted homes, cars, TVs — didn't want to wait decades
- 1993: Burger King began accepting credit cards — people were genuinely shocked at the idea of buying fast food on credit
- That shock turned into "submission and then full throttle participation very quickly"

### The Moral and Systemic Dimensions
- Personal responsibility matters (Dave Ramsey's approach works) — but "no society is well-ordered when its most profitable systems are designed to exploit human frailty"
- **Pope Leo XIV** on usury: "How far from God is the attitude of those who crush people until they become slaves... usury begins with a promise to alleviate suffering, but soon reveals itself as a burden that suffocates"
- The Pope also calls for converting the usurers themselves — "like Zacchaeus in his tree"
- Credit card usury is the "postwar liberal order's case of usury gone wild"

### What Can Be Done
- **Individual level**: Dave Ramsey's debt snowball — "has done more for America than any think tank or politician in decades"
- **Systemic alternatives**:
  - Montes Pietatis: church-backed lending institutions that protect capital but avoid exploitative profit (cited by Pope Benedict XVI)
  - Interest-free lending is possible: International Association of Jewish Free Loans reports ~97% repayment rates
  - Trade schools like the College of St. Joseph the Worker integrate income generation with education to limit front-end debt
  - Legally: limit or prohibit profit on unsecured loans (drawing on St. Thomas Aquinas)
- "Usury is not inevitable and the debt economy is not our destiny"

## 13. Youth Sports Used to be For Kids: Now It's a $40 Billion Industry | The Deep
**Channel:** The Loopcast / The Deep (Catholic cultural commentary)
**Published:** 2026-02-12 | **Duration:** ~18 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIvDhnG8wTk

### The Explosion of Youth Sports as Big Business
- Youth sports industry: estimated $30–40 billion annually — almost double Disney's annual content budget
- Average US family spent **$1,160** on one child's primary sport in 2024 (46% increase since 2019)
- Travel team sports: child athlete travel to tournaments accounts for **60% of the $52 billion sports tourism industry**
- Parents of high school athletes spend an average of **223 minutes daily** on sports activities (practice, competitions, communication, equipment)

### The Kids Are Quitting
- **70% of American kids quit organized sports by age 13** (AAP data)
- Overall participation: dropped from 58.3% (2016–17) to 54.6% — sharpest drop for boys (50% in 2013 to 41% in 2023)
- 50% of injuries in pre-teen athletes are from **overtraining** — ACL tears, shoulder/elbow damage, hip/ankle surgery now common among pre-teens
- Only **23%** of parents believe their kid will make a college team; **11%** think their child will go pro — reality: less than 2% play in college, less than 1% professionally

### The Real Currency: Belonging and Prestige
- The pay-to-play model: travel teams → elite clubs → varsity teams → recruiting camps → the dream sold at a high price
- Travel teams drain neighborhoods: when the most athletic kids leave local leagues early, rec sports hollow out, local fields sit empty, pickup games disappear
- Youth sports professionalization has become a factor in whether people are willing to have children at all

### The Deeper Loss: Sport Untethered from the Soul
- **Pope Pius XII (1952)**: "What good would it do to develop the body if it were not at the service of something more noble and lasting, which is the soul?"
- **Pope Leo XIV** on the 2026 Olympics: "When team sports are not polluted by the worship of profit, young people put themselves on the line... fundamental personal, Christian, and civic virtues take shape"
- St. Thomas Aquinas: play, like art, exists **for its own sake** — the human drama of athletic competition is not a zero-sum good
- "The fat kid in the sandlot learns perseverance the same way Rocky Balboa does"

### The CYO Model: What Worked
- 1936: Catholic Archbishop Patrick Hayes of New York established the **Catholic Youth Organization (CYO)** during the Depression
  - Goal was not elite achievement but **belonging** — parish-based, parent-supported, accessible to everyone
  - "Sports were the hook and heaven was the prize"
  - Some CYO kids became famous (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Chris Mullen), but the measure of success was the thousands who played for the love of the game and stayed rooted in community and faith

### The Path Forward
- Start from the bottom up, not top down — communities choosing "sports with a soul" over "sports empire"
- "Kids who learn how to fail without quitting... who grow up in thriving neighborhoods and parishes where their friends don't all disappear on weekends for a tournament"
- The ending of *The Sandlot*: most kids didn't go pro — "No one walks away saying they wasted all those hours. The point wasn't what use the game was. The point was the game itself."

## 14. Yes, We Are Coming For Obergefell. Here's How To Do It (w/ Katy Faust)
**Channel:** Catholic Vote / Loopcast (Catholic political commentary)
**Published:** 2026-02-10 | **Duration:** ~27 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jglg_x3RgU8

### The Greater Than Campaign: Elevator Pitch
- "Hey America, you get to choose: Do you want gay marriage, or do children have a right to their mother and father? Pick one. You can't have both."
- Katy Faust (Them Before Us) leads a coalition of conservative religious leaders, political influencers, and policy organizations called **Greater Than**
- Core argument: *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) forced a marriage policy centered on adult desires, not children's wellbeing — making husbands and wives optional in marriage made mothers and fathers optional in parenthood law

### What Obergefell Did to Children's Rights
- Stripped parenthood laws of the words "mother" and "father" — replaced with "guardians," "parent one," "parent two"
- Created new pathways to acquire children: **intent-based parenthood** and **de facto parenthood** — "state-sanctioned child trafficking: if you can assemble sperm, egg, and womb with a valid contract, the state will hand that baby to you"
- Redefined infertility from a medical condition to include same-sex couples demanding insurance-funded IVF to "manufacture motherless and fatherless children"
- California case: 21 surrogate-born children to a couple — the father was a Chinese Communist Party member planning to ship them to China as dual citizens — **completely legal** under California law

### Three Prongs of the Campaign

**1. Judicial and Policy Strategy**
- Force the natural contours of the natural family to reemerge in state law: insist on mothers/fathers, biology or adoption as legitimate parentage, block unrelated adults from claiming children
- When this triggers a constitutional challenge, reframe the question: "Do children need, deserve, and have a right to their own mother and father — or is a state-assigned stranger just as good?"

**2. Changing Public Opinion**
- Coalition of conservative influencers: Lila Rose, Michael Knowles, Allie Stuckey, Abby Johnson, the Babylon Bee, Heritage Foundation, and others
- Starting with conservatives first — "even conservatives are confused about this"
- Strategy: directly connect gay marriage with child commodification, and natural marriage with child protection
- Key insight: if you ask Americans "Do children need a mother and father?" the vast majority say "of course" — but they haven't connected that to the legal consequences of Obergefell

**3. Church Transformation**
- Turn churches into "child-centric fighting forces" with materials for both Protestants and Catholics
- Ecumenical approach: Dr. Albert Mohler and John Stonestreet (Protestant), Word on Fire (Catholic)
- Historical precedent: from the earliest church, Christianity was known for saving babies — pulling infants from trash heaps, rescuing girls from brothels
- "The church always says: we will anger adults so that we protect children"
- The modern failure: churches have reduced the gospel to "love God, love people" in a way that avoids confrontation — "if that means you are forsaking children, wrong gospel, wrong God"

## 15. My Body Is Failing, and That's a Blessing (Fr. Mike Schmitz)
**Channel:** Pints with Aquinas / Matt Fradd (Catholic podcast)
**Published:** 2025-11-05 | **Duration:** ~13 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1WWY722aow

### The Back Injury
- Fr. Mike Schmitz was doing a heavy single deadlift — felt a pop halfway up
  - First thought: "Oh shoot." Second thought: "I should finish this lift because this might be the last time I ever get to lift heavy again." Third thought: "From now on, longevity over one rep maxes."
- The next month was the **worst pain of his entire life** — a disc fragment had broken off and was pressing against the nerve
  - No position, no medication could alleviate it — shooting pain down his leg with no escape
  - "I have so much compassion now for people who have back pain"
- Surgery was a necessity, not an option — woke up and the pain was completely gone
  - "I can't even think about it now without being overwhelmed with gratitude"
- Just one week before the injury, he had specifically thanked God for his healthy body

### The Shoulder Surgery
- Had a long-standing shoulder issue he kept putting off with PT
- Eventually required surgery — immobilized for 6 weeks, range of motion for 6 more weeks, then strengthening for another 6
- Opposite experience from back: back was excruciating before surgery and relief after; shoulder was "wait, why am I doing this?" before and major pain after
- Recovery restrictions: no bending, twisting, or lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk for 6 weeks
- Gave a talk at a Eucharistic congress just 4 days after surgery (filmed remotely)

### The Spiritual Insight: Aging as Gift
- Watching parts of his body atrophy was striking — right vastus medialis still visibly smaller a year later; arm "just tiny" after shoulder surgery
- "We're so fragile... it is remarkable"
- **The key reflection**: "As we age, things need to start failing — or I remain attached"
  - Not just detachment from bad habits, but from good things: the pleasure of being strong, the identity of being physically capable
  - "Here's what life is going to be like. I'll always feel this way. I'll always be able to see... Now eyesight's failing, eardrums, everything's fading"
- This physical decline becomes a **spiritual blessing** — forcing surrender and trust rather than self-reliance
- Currently "probably the least healthy I've ever been" despite working out 5–6 times a week — learning to set new goals that are "interiorly meaningful, challenging, and yet attainable"

## 16. Receive Healing Through the Rosary
**Channel:** Gabe Castillo / Catholic conference talk
**Published:** 2025-10-13 | **Duration:** ~20 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltxdltC1hNI

### The Personal Story: A Year of Spiritual Pain
- On October 7th (Feast of the Holy Rosary), Gabe experienced a sharp spiritual pain — felt as if his soul was being stabbed, so intense it manifested physically
- Consulted three exorcists: first said "ignore it" (impossible — it hurt too much), second said "get your heart checked," third (Fr. Ambrose Venberines) said the words that liberated him: **"Clearly Our Lady is allowing this. Suffer well. Suffer like a man."**
- Key insight: "The devil is not doing a darn thing that God hasn't allowed. Mary's allowing this for my good."
- The stabbing stopped on October 13th (Feast of Our Lady of Fatima, Miracle of the Sun) — clearly connected to Marian feast days

### Discovering the Root Wound
- Later experienced waves of crippling anxiety before speaking engagements, then spiraled into panic about his son growing up and leaving
- Recognized it as a **familiar demon** hiding in an old wound — his father abandoning him as a child
- The abandonment wound had been collecting other wounds like "a barnacle at the bottom of a ship"
- Pattern recognition: Steve Jobs was adopted, rejected by second family, then repeated the cycle by not claiming his own daughter — "perpetuating the sin that he experienced"

### The Healing Rosary Method
- **Signs you need healing**: disordered amount of pain from situations, disproportionate emotional responses, or psychological habits you can't explain (e.g., inability to trust men after a father wound)
- **The method** (a form of mental prayer):
  1. Float back to the **earliest memory** of the wound
  2. Replay the scene — then pause and go to "little you"
  3. Tell that child what they needed to hear: "It's not your fault. You're loved by God."
  4. Take that child to one of the **Sorrowful Mysteries** (e.g., the Scourging at the Pillar)
  5. Be still and let Jesus do whatever He wants in that scene
  6. Notice the healing — described as a "cool breeze" over the wound
- **How to know you're healed**: you can think about the memory and "it doesn't hurt anymore — you can be upset about the injustice, but it doesn't pierce you"
- Small wounds may need only one decade of the rosary; lifelong wounds may require going through every mystery from different angles

### Forgiveness as the Prerequisite
- "You cannot be healed unless you forgive"
- Forgiveness is NOT: the other person saying sorry, you feeling better about it, or saying "it's fine, not that bad"
- Forgiveness IS: **the debt is paid — they don't owe you an apology**
- "You deserve an apology. That's called reconciliation. But in order for you to have peace, you've got to let go."
- Final step: ask God to bless them — "bless them with the grace of repentance, the grace to save their souls"
- St. Maria Goretti's example: stabbed 14 times, dying words were "Tell Alessandro, I forgive him and I want him to be with me in heaven"

## 17. COIN STORIES CLIPS: Mark Moss on Bitcoin Volatility, Gold vs Bonds & the End of 80% BTC Drawdowns
**Channel:** Coin Stories (Bitcoin/macro interview clips)
**Published:** 2025-10-15 | **Duration:** ~10 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBEqw-PSBlg

### The End of 80% Bitcoin Drawdowns
- Since the ETFs launched, **Bitcoin volatility has completely collapsed** — trading firms trying to generate yield from options/rolling strategies are seeing poor year-to-date numbers because volatility is so compressed
- The "fiat maxi" mentality: traders who sell BTC at 90K to buy back at 70K are trying to accumulate dollars, not Bitcoin — "that strategy doesn't get you more Bitcoin"
- Three reasons the big drawdown probably won't happen:
  1. ETF volatility compression
  2. ETFs and treasury companies buying **~10x more Bitcoin** than new supply being created — massive supply-demand imbalance
  3. If the 4-year halving cycle holds, cutting supply in half from here is "inconsequential to the demand that's there"

### The Geopolitical Chess Game: Dollar, Gold, Stablecoins
- Dollar reserve status under threat: nations moving away since 2013 (Russia/China de-dollarization); culminated when US/NATO seized Russia's bank accounts during Ukraine invasion
- Central banks worldwide are **net buyers of gold** — BRICS moving to gold settlement
- Trump's strategy via the **GENIUS Act**: push stablecoins globally to maintain the dollar at ~60% of global trade
  - Stablecoin issuers must buy US Treasuries → creates new demand for US debt
  - People worldwide (Lebanon, Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela) are desperate for dollars but face capital controls — stablecoins provide an easy on-ramp
- Scott Bessent (US Treasury head) predicts stablecoins should reach **$3.7 trillion by 2030**
- The $3.2 trillion question: banks sitting on **$3.2 trillion in sterilized reserves** (from post-2008 quantitative easing) could potentially create stablecoins against this money — "pretty close to what Bessent said of 3.7 trillion"
  - If projected from current stablecoin growth rates, this number could be hit by ~2027
  - "That's how they'll get the inflation they need to grow the economy. Trump wants to let it run hot."
- Russia's counterargument: the US wants to "put all the $37 trillion debt into the crypto-cloud and inflate it away" — Mark Moss pushes back: stablecoins require $1 in to generate $1 coin, unlike fractional reserve gold certificates

### The Bond Holder Liquidation
- IMF and BIS published a white paper titled "The Liquidation of Government Debt" — the playbook (financial repression) was used by both US and UK after WWII
- Bond holders are being liquidated by being paid **less than inflation** — "stealing 3–4% per year"
- When Musk left DOGE, he said "there's no hope — we have to grow our way out of it." Bessent echoed the same: "We have to grow our way out of it."

## 18. 17 Small Habits That Made Me Rich!
**Channel:** Mark Moss (investing/entrepreneurship)
**Published:** 2025-04-30 | **Duration:** ~30 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCkhcPH2PI0

### Mindset & Morning Habits (1–5)

**Habit 1: The Gratitude Advantage**
- Write three things every night: What did I learn today? What am I grateful for? What did I do well?
- Uses a Google Form for this nightly ritual
- "Optimism is mandatory for wealth creation" — pessimists never get ahead because they fixate on what could go wrong

**Habit 2: The Capture Rule — "If You Can Think It, Ink It"**
- Your brain is for creating ideas, not storing them — "You don't have the luxury of having the same thought twice"
- Evolution of his system: notebook → Evernote → wearable AI device that auto-routes tagged items to his assistant

**Habit 3: Win Your Morning, Win Your Day**
- Pre-decide tomorrow's tasks the night before — schedule creative work in the morning, reviews/planning in the evening
- One main non-negotiable task + three additional tasks

**Habit 4: Eat the Frog First**
- Do the hardest/most dreaded task first thing — personal example: moved gym from after work to early morning; took years of dark-morning willpower but now it's ingrained

**Habit 5: Habit Stacking**
- Attach new habits to existing ones: after gym (existing), immediately create social media content (new)

### Productivity & Decision-Making (6–9)

**Habit 6: The Time Vault**
- Budget your time like money — don't default to 1-hour meetings if 15 minutes will do
- Conduct a time audit multiple times per year: track all time for two weeks, review, set new calendar blocks

**Habit 7: The Decision Diet**
- Decision fatigue is real — eliminate recurring decisions: wears a black shirt every day, eats the same lunch, standing monthly haircut appointment
- "Fewer decisions mean more mental bandwidth for higher-value things"

**Habit 8: Curate to Elevate**
- Don't consume raw news — subscribe to curated newsletters where experts have already filtered
- Social media curation: maintains specific X/Twitter lists (macro, Bitcoin, AI); follows zero friends on Instagram — only industry sources

**Habit 9: The Idea Factory**
- From Brian Tracy: write 10 ideas every morning on paper — at first they'll be terrible ("just gibberish"), but after 15 years: "I can't turn it off"

### Learning & Growth (10–11)

**Habit 10: Just-In-Time Learning**
- "Only knowledge APPLIED is power" — learn exactly what you need for the problem in front of you
- Three levels: receive → apply immediately → teach others

**Habit 11: The Growth Budget**
- Highest ROI investment is personal growth — attends 1–2 masterminds/year ($25K–$50K each)
- 2008 lesson: got completely wiped out, invested hundreds of thousands into education — "Knowledge can never be taken from me"

### Financial Systems (12–14)

**Habit 12: Autopilot Your Wealth**
- All income → one primary account (never spend from it) → auto-distributes to purpose-specific accounts (car, loans, bills)

**Habit 13: Weekly Wealth Pulse**
- Review three reports every Friday: P&L, Statement of Cash Flows, Balance Sheet (the "scorecard")
- "The goal is to take earned income and turn it into assets"

**Habit 14: Income Insurance**
- Diversify income — does NOT mean starting multiple businesses; means multiple customers, multiple products within your core competency
- For employees: build side skills or income streams — "At least have the skills... the one thing they can't take away"

### Life Design (15–17)

**Habit 15: Build or Be Built**
- Engineer your ideal life intentionally via "future pacing": write out your ideal average day in detail, summarize into one statement, print it out where you see it daily

**Habit 16: The Legacy Lens**
- Daily journaling on: What gives me energy? What drains it? What do I want more/less of?

**Habit 17: Blissfully Dissatisfied**
- Balance contentment with ambition — be content with progress while pushing to improve in health, relationships, business, and personal goals
- "The key to getting rich isn't dramatic lifestyle changes — it's small daily habits that stack and compound over years, making wealth not just easy but inevitable"

## 19. 10 Millionaires Asked Me How to Get Richer
**Channel:** Alex Hormozi (business/entrepreneurship)
**Published:** 2024-07-23 | **Duration:** ~60 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m6DCQMASEM

### Millionaire #1 — Online Fitness Coaching ($3.7K LTV, LinkedIn Ads)
- **Problem**: Can't scale profitably above ~$1,500/day ad spend; not enough creative
- **Key advice**: Switch from selling packages by duration to a **diagnostic sale model** — price per week × weeks needed to reach their goal, with a guarantee
  - "You're selling the goal rather than selling programs — you'll convert a way higher percentage"
- Add supplement sales on a 48-hour follow-up nutrition consult — can add $500–$2,000/client with zero delivery burden

### Millionaire #2 — Spanish Language Coaching ($3K LTV, Meta Ads)
- **Problem**: Too many low-salary leads, wants to reach executives
- **Key advice**: Don't kill the profitable channel — **fix LTV first**
  - Adding a performance-based upsell could take LTV from $3K to $10–12K, turning 3:1 ROAS into effectively 12:1
  - "You might just be fine and just need to tweak the LTV"

### Millionaire #3 — Real Estate Wholesaling (Sales Team Crisis)
- **Problem**: Dropped from 70 to 40 deals/month after sales manager left; promoted top closer to manager (can't coach)
- **Key advice**: The CEO must understand sales personally — "If a sales director says 'double my pay or I'm leaving,' you should be able to say 'I can name 10 people who can do it better because I trained them'"
- Sales training = **watching game tape + corrective role-playing**, not lectures
- "Make the script the Bible — everyone follows it word for word. If they all follow it and don't close, now you can tweak the script and it changes how everyone performs"

### Millionaire #4 — Used Car Dealership ($500–600K Profit)
- **Problem**: Key man problem — needs people but hasn't hired leadership
- **Key advice**: "When I hear six problems, it's people. You need help. You're missing three smart people."
- **Hire a finance person (controller/CFO) first**: "I'll bet you could double your margin from someone with finance discipline." Pitch: "I can't afford you — find your salary in cost savings within 90 days"

### Millionaire #5 — Enterprise Web Dev Agency (Whale Client Dependency)
- **Problem**: 90% of revenue from 2 clients; co-founder responsible for sales keeps getting pulled into delivery
- **Key advice**: "You presented with a sales problem, but you have a hard conversation with a co-founder to have"
  - "I will take over 100% of delivery if you go get us customers. If you don't get us customers, then one of us isn't necessary."
  - Use criticism (statement about discrepancy), not insults (attack on character)

### Millionaire #6 — Anime E-Commerce Clothing Brand (Discord, 14K Members)
- **Problem**: Should resources go to scaling clothing sales or building IP universe?
- **Key advice**: It's not either/or — fund the IP from the economic engine
  - "Mickey Mouse has to sell shirts, hats, t-shirts, movies"
  - Study Walt Disney obsessively; study Gary Vee's VFriends
  - Never say "creating value out of nothing" — especially tied to NFTs

### Millionaire #7 — Cannabis Paid Ads Agency ($600K Revenue, ~$90K Profit)
- **Problem**: Wants to hire but $90K profit leaves no room
- **Key advice**: "You don't have a people problem, you have a model problem"
  - Two paths: 10x efficiency (serve 10x customers with same effort) or 10x price
  - "Trying to scale what you're currently doing is a bad idea. Fix it so you CAN scale it."

### Millionaire #8 — Garage Door Company ($7M Revenue, Acquired)
- **Problem**: All leads from home warranty companies; zero marketing engine
- **Key advice**: "Start with vendors, then bring in-house" — hire the agency, learn from them, train your person, take over in 6 months
  - **PPC**: Use an agency (stable once cracked for local)
  - **Social media ads**: Must be in-house — creative gets tired every 2–3 weeks in local markets
  - Go from 8 warranty partners to 20+ while stacking new channels on top

### Millionaire #9 — Paid Ads Agency (Targeting $100K+/Month Spenders)
- **Problem**: Not enough SQLs for big accounts; clients eventually bring ads in-house
- **Key advice**: **Proactively offer the transition to consulting** — "We'll switch to consulting and mentor your team. If they never outperform us, you stay on consulting forever."
  - Shifts from subservient provider to teacher/consultant; extends LTV
  - Go outbound for $100K+ clients: cold call, cold DM, run targeted LinkedIn ads that are exclusionary: "If you're not spending $100K/month, please just scroll past this ad"

### Millionaire #10 — Dental Implant Practice (15 Years)
- **Problem**: Declining lead quality from 8-year-old Google Ads; pricing strategy uncertainty
- **Key advice**: "Just raise the price" — acquired a company, doubled the price, settled on 50% increase — close rates went UP
  - "We sold a higher percentage of people at 50% more money... that's the beautiful thing with price increases — it's all profit"
  - Document your natural sales process (you already have one), then train the team on it
  - Ultimate play: acquire other dental practices and install your systems on top

### Overarching Themes
- **Fix the model before scaling** — scaling a broken model just amplifies the problem
- **Price increases are the highest-leverage move** — often all profit with no drop in close rates
- **Don't kill what's working — stack new channels on top**
- **LTV fixes solve multiple problems at once** — ad spend, diminishing returns, profitability
- **You need people, not more ideas** — three smart hires can transform a business
- **Start with vendors/agencies, then bring in-house** within 6 months
- **The CEO must understand the core function** — otherwise whoever holds that seat has leverage over you

## 20. The Devil Admitted This About the Mother of Mercy…
**Channel:** Gabe Castillo (Catholic teaching)
**Published:** 2025-05-21 | **Duration:** ~13 min
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi7Iya3W2C8

### Mary's Role: She Descends and Ascends
- St. Alphonsus Liguori tells of a priest performing an exorcism who asks the demon: "What is Mary doing right now?"
- The demon replied: **"She's descending and ascending"** — she descends to bring grace to men, then ascends back to God to present supplications
- We sometimes receive grace through Mary's intercession that we otherwise may not have received — and we receive it **quicker** than going directly to Jesus

### Why Mary's Intercession Is Uniquely Powerful
- When we go to Jesus directly, we approach both the one who has mercy AND the one who executes justice
- When we go to Mary, **she only knows mercy** — the Church never calls her "the just mother" or "mother of vengeance," only **"Mother of Mercy"** (as in the Hail Holy Queen)
- The judge's mother analogy: you've exhausted every defense — lawyers, character witnesses — but the judge is unmoved. Then the judge's mother comes in and speaks for you, and he is moved. Why? "By the time the judge was born, he already owed her nine months of room and board"

### Mary's Requests as "Omnipotent"
- St. Alphonsus calls Mary's prayers before God **omnipotent** — but clarifies: Jesus is all-powerful by nature; Mary is all-powerful **by grace**
  - "As the power of the son and the mother are the same, the mother by the omnipotent son is made omnipotent"
- St. Bridget's mystical vision: Jesus says to Mary, "Ask from me whatever you desire, for there is no demand of thine that will not be graciously heard by me"
- Why? Because Mary refused Jesus nothing during her earthly life:
  - The Annunciation was a potential death sentence (Deuteronomy 22:23–24: engaged women found pregnant could be stoned) — yet she said "I am the handmaid of the Lord"
  - The unusual birth in a stable, the flight to Egypt, right through to the cross — "she never grumbles, never complains"

### Contrast: Power Given to Evil vs. Power Given to Good
- Herod also said "Ask for anything you wish" — to Herodias's daughter, who asked for the head of John the Baptist. **Power given to an evil person = death.**
- Power given to Mary, perfected in all virtue, no sin = **life**
- In St. Bridget's vision, when Jesus tells Mary "Ask anything you desire," Mary replies: **"I ask for mercy."**

### Practical Application
- Are you overwhelmed? Sick? Struggling with faith? Heart hardened by sin? Feeling God is distant?
- "You have a Mother of Mercy. She's before Jesus and she says: 'My son, I ask for mercy.'"
- "Place your life into the hands of Mary. She presents your cares before Jesus as though they are her own."
