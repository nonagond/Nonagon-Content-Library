Kind: captions Language: en He lost everything. His office, his reputation, his future. &gt;&gt; Then almost overnight, everything was restored. &gt;&gt; The bishop welcomed him back. The crowd accepted him again. No explanation was given. &gt;&gt; But the restoration came before repentance. &gt;&gt; Because what brought him back to power was not forgiveness. It was a contract. &gt;&gt; And it demanded something no person should give. Welcome to episode 6 of Lent Daily, where we're sharing stories from our Catholic tradition marked by a sign or wonder of God that call us to conversion. Today's story begins with a man who signed his soul away in his own blood. &gt;&gt; In the year of our Lord 537, there lived a man named Theophilles. He served as vicor to a bishop, entrusted with the church's goods and the ordering of its affairs. He carried that responsibility faithfully with such prudence that he was widely respected. When the bishop died, many urged that Theophilles should take his place. &gt;&gt; But he refused the dignity. He said the office he held was enough for him. Another bishop was appointed &gt;&gt; and soon after through false accusation and malice, the offis was stripped of his position. &gt;&gt; The loss was public. The reversal was visible and the humiliation was complete. &gt;&gt; What was taken from him was not only authority but standing. And in that wound, despair took root. &gt;&gt; Theophilles did not accept his fall. Stripped of office and wounded in honor, he searched for a way back. Not for peace, but for restoration. &gt;&gt; And desperation narrowed his choices. In that state, he went to a Jew known for magical arts. The man summoned the devil, and the devil answered, &gt;&gt; "The terms were clear. If Theophilles wanted his office restored, obedience would be required." &gt;&gt; He was commanded to renounce Jesus Christ and to renounce Mary, his mother, by name, and Theophilles consented. &gt;&gt; He wrote the renunciation with his own hand. He sealed it with his blood and he delivered it to the devil as a binding contract. &gt;&gt; The next morning, the bishop received him again. No resistance, no delay, no explanation. Theophilles was restored to his position. &gt;&gt; Outwardly, everything appeared resolved, but what he had regained in public, he had already surrendered in secret. &gt;&gt; What followed the restoration was not peace. Theophilus was seized by remorse. &gt;&gt; He wept continually. He could not escape what he had done. &gt;&gt; At last he went into the church and cast himself before an altar of the blessed virgin. &gt;&gt; There he remained weeping and praying, placing all his hope in her mercy. For 40 days he persevered in tears, in fasting, in prayer. Then one night the Virgin Mary appeared to him. She spoke to him with sorrow. &gt;&gt; Theophilles, what have you done? You have turned away from my friendship and from the friendship of my son, and you have done so for your enemy and mine. &gt;&gt; He answered her, not with excuses, but with surrender. Oh lady, it is for you to obtain my pardon from your son. &gt;&gt; Take courage. I will pray for you. Strengthened by her words, Theophilles returned to the altar. He returned with contrition. He persevered in prayer and he did not cease. Then the virgin appeared to him again. This time her face was joyful. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. I have presented your tears and prayers to God. They have been accepted. You have been forgiven. Remain grateful and faithful. But one fear still weighed upon Theophilles. The enemy still held the written renunciation. &gt;&gt; Theophilles begged our lady that the writing be taken from him. &gt;&gt; 3 days later he awoke in the night. The document lay upon his breast. What he had surrendered was now returned. &gt;&gt; Theophilles brought the writing to the bishop. Before the clergy and the people, he confessed everything. The document was burned. The enemy's claim was ended publicly. &gt;&gt; 3 days later, Theophilus died, not in despair, but reconciled. The one who had fallen was restored. &gt;&gt; He died a holy death by Mary's intercession, and the claim against him was gone. Today's story comes to us again from the glories of Mary with St. Alphonsus. But interesting, this is also found in another volume called the golden legend that I think St. Alphonsus is borrowing from. And the golden legend was written in the 1200s. And so this is an old story within our Catholic tradition. And &gt;&gt; yeah, I just find it so interesting like that people actually write contracts with the devil in their own blood. &gt;&gt; So, you know, we know this can happen. This is this is a a terrible thing that someone could do to allow themselves to be possessed. We've I've heard exorcists speak about this, but I sometimes again we share these stories. I think, well, how does that relate? Like, I haven't written an agreement with the devil in my own blood. &gt;&gt; But I do think that we all agree with him in some way. Every time we commit a venial sin, we're agreeing with the kingdom of darkness in some way. Every time, particularly when we commit a mortal sin, we're agreeing with the devil in some way. M &gt;&gt; and by this sin we do give the devil especially mortal sin some legal access to our life and so to regain that area of our life under the lordship of Jesus Christ it is necessary to go to the sacrament of confession for that is the only way mortal sin can be forgiven and sometimes we're ashamed to go to the sacrament right we're like oh we got to tell the priest my worst moment &gt;&gt; I heard our our pastor previous to the one we say that in the confession he doesn't see people at their worst. He sees them at their best. So it's an act of humility to go before Jesus and say, "Lord, this is how I have offended you." &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Now, let's circle back to the beginning of the story with Theophilos. Something disagreeable happened to him, right? He starts off pretty good. He's helping out the bishop and then he declines the position of bishop because of a great act of humility. supposedly I'm not worthy of that. And then he loses his position within the next bishop. So something unpleasant happened to him. He was humbled. Have you ever had that happen to you? Something unpleasant has happened in your life and you are humbled. It might not be losing a great position like that, but just in everyday living, &gt;&gt; I know we have lots of things unpleasant happening in our household. Just a couple days ago, how many kids did we have throwing up in the middle of the night? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there was like six. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's lots of kids sick. &gt;&gt; No exaggeration. It was the craziest night I think we've ever had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For sickness with kids. &gt;&gt; And it was on Ash Wednesday night. It was like, let's get started with this Lenton series with a bang &gt;&gt; and dry heaving and just like it was just terrible, unpleasant. Unpleasant. Right. So has something unpleasant happened to you already this Lent? Well, this is how St. Alfasa says we should respond. &gt;&gt; When anything disagreeable happens, remember it comes from God and say it once, this comes from God and be at peace. &gt;&gt; So there you have it. Uh when something disagreeable happens to you, just say it is the Lord. Pretty simple &gt;&gt; but not easy to live, right? &gt;&gt; Because our pride fights against this. And so St. Alphonsus gives some practical advice and he he points to St. Teresa of Avala who said that she had a habit of 50 times a day recommending herself to God. So in other how do you do that? Well something happens in your life say Jesus I trust in you or Lord this is from your hand or um let it be done to me according to thy word echoing &gt;&gt; Mary with Gabriel but his point St. Fos is saying when something is disagreeable to your will where whether it be a humiliation or something else is just to acknowledge that for some reason the Lord has allowed it. &gt;&gt; And so then our response to that is surrender &gt;&gt; offering oursel to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I know one thing that's really helped me whenever something happens that kind of frustrates me I'm like well who am I to to be upset about it because the Lord has allowed it &gt;&gt; right? And so the Lord has allowed you to be with us. TR it is the Lord. Thank you for being with us. Share with us below what has stood out to you and why. And we will see you on Monday.
