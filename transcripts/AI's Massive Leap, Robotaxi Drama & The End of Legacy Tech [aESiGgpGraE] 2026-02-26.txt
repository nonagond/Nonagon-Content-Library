Kind: captions Language: en Hello everybody. Thank you for joining. It's Thursday. The markets still suck. Everything is just nothing's going anywhere. Companies have great results and they fall down. There's just no catalyst. I think it's because everybody is very concerned about this topic that we talk about every single Thursday. It's called AI impact. And today's story is called the end of legacy. Thank you all for coming. Thank you to the moderators in chat. Let's do a whip around the world of everything that happened, the top 50 stories over the last week. And one thing I do want to stress again is the rate of change. Uh the AI hype is not slowing down, not by any stretch of the imagination. And legacy modes are being wiped out. And the big question is, is it better to be in a startup or in a legacy company? We'll try to tackle that as well. So, let's get into it. Big thank you to everybody for coming. DBF, how are you, buddy? Hope all is well down there in Australia. And this is not financial advice, of course, and a big shout out to Patreon. This is from Auntie, my first Patreon ever. Thank you for being here. And the impact playlist will be above afterwards. First, let's talk about robo taxi. A lot of drama in this whole realm. Some people believe autonomous vehicles will be one of the biggest total addressable markets ever to hit the planet. And we had good news out of Giga Austin. This is the first ever uh row cyber cab being produced out of the unbox process. We had people like Joe Tegmire. He so was in the factory for a special tour. He saw hundreds of cyber cabs in the factory. Again, no steering wheel, no pedals, etc. And uh I made a video yesterday about what would happen if you can actually buy these for yourselves. Does it make sense to run your own little robo taxi fleet, Cybergap fleet? The answer is yesterday. And also the growth is pretty special, more than doubling since January 1st. The fleet, you can see for some reason Austin has stalled at around 100 cars, but Bay Area keeps on going up. They're really ramping the area. And we have 404 observed cars. What I mean by observed cars, there's more than that, but there are the license plates that have been registered within this tracker and the guy here. So, everybody's talking about these things and how big they could be because if you take the human out of the equation, you save a buck 20 per mile and that's a big part of it. Also, if you have a very cheap car to manufacture, very comfortable, luxurious and cheap, that changes the game. Now, a lot of chatter as well about Wave. Wave is the new UK, shout out to everybody in the UK. They're new robo taxi player. Wave is the embodied AI company that is focusing on building robo taxi software so they can license to companies. They are backed, they just raised $1.2 billion at an $ 8.6 billion valuation. They're backed by Microsoft, Nvidia, Uber, Mercedes, Nissan, and Stalantis. Super interesting. How are they going to do it? Well, apparently a lot of people are very confident they have what Tesla has, but what Tesla have is a little bit different. But their focus is to license their technology, kind of like what Nvidia does, to car makers so they can have their own FSD capability cars driving around themselves. A couple of things you will notice is they seem to have stuff on the roof of their car. This is from their website this morning. Wave the realistic timeline seems to have a big kind of like what do you call a roof carrier roof rack on top with cameras and sensors and everything else. It's pretty pretty ugly. And uh they do have a kit that they sell to car makers, but the question is how far will they get? You know, the cars themselves will still need a lot of modification to be able to control to be controlled electronically by a suite of software which this company sells. And looking at all the data that I could find, yeah, they have the huge bar on top. They might be able to ship layer two, level two, level three driving maybe Nissan and Mercedes by 2028. So don't hold your breath. It's still two or three years away. And maybe level four, a 30% chance by 2030. So this isn't going to take the world by storm. And by the time that they maybe do, if they have a 30% odds of taking the world by storm, they won't be able to do it till 2030, by which time Tesla will be everywhere. So that is the situation. But that being said, it is important to note that AI rate of change is changing everything very dramatically, very fast. This is a new word you're going to hear about a lot called CAM, which is computer action model. This is from standard intelligence. And basically it's a model where they can watch millions of hours of footage and at the end of that time the AI can learn just from watching videos how to do things like computer AED design like drive a car like build a brick wall that type of stuff. This could be huge. If it is possible, and I believe it is, that AI can learn by watching videos cuz that's how Tesla FSD trains, then everybody can do everything. But no, this is where the new world hardware becomes the very hard thing to do. The software piece, the AI agent piece, the SAS piece, whatever you call it, becomes very easy because AI can do that. But to actually physically build the devices at scale that are vertically integrated with all the components like inference chips and sensor suite etc is extremely difficult and that problem is not going away. So yeah, I do believe AI will be able to solve things like self-driving but you're still going to need to manufacture the car and that's still probably going to be 2029 2030 away if they have enough chance of that. Remember Tesla have 10 billion miles nearly under their belt. FSD miles and there's a large march of nines of edge cases and stuff that you can't just learn from watching a million hours of video. Anyway, we'll see where all this goes. One of the other things that is happening though as well, it was a cool interview this week with Steven Bartlett and he asked Dara, the CEO of Uber, he said, "What's going to happen to the 9 million Uber drivers?" Because Dara, the CEO of Uber, is leaning into autonomy. You can see they also invested in wave and other players invested in autonomous vehicle charging etc etc and Dra was stumped he couldn't answer the question for a long time then he eventually said I don't know so again autonomy is coming autonomy is here it's already running around Austin and the Bay Area California and Whimo is also running around all over the place the question is how fast will it scale right now we are just scratching the surface of penetration for these autonomous vehicles. The other big thing that's happening is humanoid robots. I mean, if you look to China, there are probably 100 or more humanoid robot companies and they can dance and they can box and they can do kung fu really, really well. The question is what happens next and who's going to win? Because a lot of people say, "Oh, China. I believe China will probably win AI because it's got the most energy and the most compute and they're leaning into it very hard." The US has limitations. Europe probably has limitations. But in terms of these things, again, it goes back to my point about hardware. Hardware piece is hard. Manufacturing at scale is hard. Dexterity of hands is really hard. And that's why if you take companies like Tesla versus the top Chinese EV manufacturer BYD, BYD aren't even close to the manufacturing capability of Tesla. Anyway, back to this one. Everybody's very excited for the Optimus Gen 3 unveil. It's still scheduled for Q1 2026. Tesla is winding down their production lines of the SNX and Fremont to become that million plus Optimus factory a year. And again, we should see human level proficiency come out of this robot. The unveil. Let me see Q1. We don't have long left. We got a month and a week, five weeks or less left. if it even happens. We shall see. It'll be interesting to watch. But also, Nvidia came out with their earnings yesterday, which are smoking hot. Covered that already. But uh Jensen confirms uh physical AI is here and it is the next inflection point beyond Agentic is take taking AI into manufacturing by storm. And this is a giant opportunity. And the CFO, if I'm not mistaken, confirmed that physical AI already contributed 6 billion to 2026 revenue. And they have a whole bunch of stuff happening all over the world with all their different partners and are making huge investments. Nvidia, by the way, again, small world. They're also investing in Wave, which is part of this whole robots are everywhere. Uh Nvidia are also selling selling a toolkit so car makers can actually set up their own FSD and stuff. It's all happening very fast. Also Google the huge player. Google have had their own robotics division for years. They even bought um Boston Dynamics if I'm not mistaken and then couldn't get it to scale to sell in a productive way. So they got rid of it and sold it to Hyundai. But anyway, what they did recently, they just folded their intrinsic robotics lab into Google DeepMind as of yesterday. And this will be huge as well because now uh it's under kind of deep deep kind of think of it as Android for physical AI capabilities where their robots, you know, they've got a thing called Mag 7 arms and other things that they can use across different factories. Their play might be different. It may not be humanoids. It may be other types of robots that can be used in industrial purposes. Either way, do not fade Google. They have their fingers in everything. Everything. Also, this is kind of this should nearly be a meme of the day. But in Japan, they have a butteroid, basically a humanoid butter, and it's AI powered, and it has been trained in centuries of Buddhist scripture. So, yeah. If you need whatever to preach with the Buddha thing, you now have a robot for that. So, and that robot will remember again hundreds and hundreds of years of Buddhist scripture. Pretty incredible if you're into that type of thing. Let's get on to the Mag 7. A lot of change there, too, this week. Uh, Reuben is ready to go. It's their next massive leap and it'll be shipping shortly in a quarter, they say. And the numbers are crazy. 10x more efficient, more performance, cheaper inference, and 4x fewer GPUs to train the same models. And this is crazy. This will help with a lot of the energy bottleneck. If you have one machine that's 4x better across many parameters, that's a multiple. That could be a step change in efficiency, and that's where they're playing. So, these proven things like the Blackwells will probably sell like hotcakes. And we saw that yesterday as well. The data center revenues go vertical. Okay, this number shouldn't even be real. They made $68.1 billion in a quarter. That's more in 90 days than the entire company made two years ago. It's crazy how fast they're growing. And uh again, this business is not slowing down. A lot of people are fading AI. And yes, there could be bottlenecks. We'll get to those bottlenecks like the memories and the power and the chips, but not at the rate of progress that we're seeing right now and the demand. But there are a lot of scary stories out there. A lot of people believe Nvidia has been selling their data center GPUs to companies in Singapore who in turn are moving them over to China. And that has a lot of people concerned. But again, it's very hard to, you know, prevent these boxes getting anywhere. You sell it in one country, goes in the back of a truck, ends up in another country the next day. That's just the nature of the business. Anyway, we'll see where it all goes. And AMD and Meta put together a huge partnership as well this week. And AI Capex keeps exploding. The overall deal between Meta and AMD is going to be like 600 to 700 billion dollars over multiple years. And this is absolutely massive. Again, AMD also make a lot of hundreds of thousands of GPUs that will consume gigawatts of power. And again, AMD, just like Nvidia, stands to be a huge beneficiary of that. The jury is out in my opinion if Meta will win the AI wars. I don't think so. But a lot of people believe maybe they could either way. the person or the group, the company selling the pickaxes and the denim jeans, just like in the old gold rush days, they will continue to make money. And bottlenecks, a little bit of bottleneck talk here from Logan. The compute bottleneck is massively underappreciated. I would guess the gap between supply and demand is growing by singledigit percentages every day. If you map out exactly what he means, that is staggering. And that means the companies like Nvidia and AMD are going to be just fine. So even though Nvidia sold off a little bit after earnings still shouldn't be a concern there at all. The amount of money that's required if this is true, but I would also argue there's also a memory shortage and by the end of this year a massive power shortage too. Let's get into AI and LLMs as we go around the world. This is just puts in things into perspective like we just covered regarding power and GPUs and data centers. Very important. Couple of quick reference points here. XA's Colossus 2 is the largest and most powerful single AI supercluster on the planet. They have 555,000 GPUs up and running and use up to 2 GW of power as of right now. Meta for comparison have 150,000 GPUs, use a quarter of that power. Open AI, Microsoft have a 100,000 GPUs. I'm not sure what power they use. And Google have 300 megawws of power. They have double what Meta has, but guess what? XAI has nearly 6x what Meta has, what what Google have. And Google are a absolute powerhouse. So again, but what's also crazy, they have all of this in one location, which would also make me a little bit concerned if that location is attacked or damaged. Anyhow, moving on back to AI cursors cloud agents can now build, test, and ship code autonomously. Humans are not required. I've heard some complaints, shout out to Stepbackj as well, that cursor has gotten very expensive and it's not as good as other solutions, but at the same time, it can do everything, which is kind of terrifying. And we continue to see the impact of AI across different industries. It's nearly every single day in the last few days, we see how Agentic AI startups or Agentic AI keeps eating legacy businesses alive. It started with some type of coding shops and SAS software, security software, data vendors. The latest is IBM and Cobalt because Anthropics Claude said they could read Cobalt and fix cobalt code. A lot of people, a lot of developers who've been in business for 70 plus years or at 70 years of age still maintaining Cobalt because there are so many IBM mainframes running around that run on Cobalt and it's a bear of a language and younger generation don't have the skills to manage it. But now AI agents can technically debug Cobalt code which is big. Next in the box, we're not sure, but other professions will come. And this is literally hammering the markets. We had a feeling Q1 2026 would be bad, but the amount of devastation is crazy. Like IBM lost $40 billion of market cap in a day just because somebody posted, "Oh, Enthropic can read cobalt." Boom. Crazy. Now, this is another big impact of AI from Austin Reef. He talks about uh my his friend who works at a large private equity firm. Uh so, we just had a firmwide meeting about how we don't need associates anymore, which is terrible because people need to get started somewhere. And a typical private equity associate makes about $200,000 a year to do three things. build Excel models, turn excess models into PowerPoint decks and email them to somebody senior on their behalf. Now you have maybe Claude for 20 bucks a month will do everything for $20 a month. So the world is changing very very very fast and it's only going to accelerate which is very alarming and there's I I hate saying this alarming stuff but the amount of things that are happening so fast I cannot stress there's this system called Pulsia and they can run a complete enterprise company for $180 a day that does things like sending 3,000 emails a day. It does designs. It runs operations. It runs workshops. It onboards new employees. It does all the type of things a big corporation would do. It's now running for $180 a day through one AI. Staggering to even think about. And speaking of staggering, the AI tsunami is back. This is Dario who said, "The public is not aware what's about to happen. There doesn't seem to be a wider recognition of society of what's about to happen. It's as if this tsunami is coming at us and it's so close. We can see it on the horizon. He's not the only doomer out there. And I hope they're all wrong. But my job is to help you all be aware of what potentially is coming. Elon Musk did say big supersonic tsunami is coming. His words. Now Dario is using the same term. He can see the tsunami on the horizon which means it's hours away. If you know about tsunamis also Andre Karpathi said as well it's hard to communicate how much programming has changed just in the last two months 8 weeks. He can't even explain how much has changed. So it's his interpretation of what type of tsunami is coming. Everything is changing particularly in the coding world. In fact coding is the very first door I put in here when I created this little meme. Now, let's move on. Pentagon because the government is now involved in AI, too. And the Pentagon is pressuring Claude for AI safety limits. They want whatever AI they use to be buttoned up. And the Pentagon actually ended up doing a deal with Elon Musk's Grock and they are apparently allegedly maybe as of last week trying to shut down Claude within the whole of the Pentagon. But can you imagine what happens when operations like the Pentagon are using AI and that AI is not safe and secure and balanced and it takes control. Well, then you get to war games which becomes very serious. And I did this is a a very serious video today. So sorry about the serious nature, but I shouldn't be here sugar coating things. Then we get to drones. The drones are things that are purchased by firms like or operated like the Pentagon. And Fury is Andrew's first jet. First time ever a private company like this was able to make a jet that can fly at the speed of sound. And it's AI powered. It's basically an unmanned fighter jet just like an F-35 or an F-22 Raptor. And it uses AI to detect, engage threats, carry weapons, and enter high-risk missions without any humans in danger. So, another version of a drone, but it's not just a little little flying thing about this long, but it's a full-on fighter jet, which is completely AI powered. And other startups are coming, too. I did say drones and defense would be massive narrative in 2026. Well, this one is too. Seronic. I never heard of them until this morning. Seronic raises $1 half billion at a $9 billion valuation. Again, they went up 2.3x in a year in their value. And they make ships that are drones, military boats. Some of them are 20 ft long, some of them are a lot bigger, but they can do things like deploy drones deep into the ocean. I can't remember the exact numbers, but they can travel a,000 miles in a very short window of time at 35 knots. For any kids that don't want to do the math, calculate 35 knots speed, how long it takes them to go a,000 miles into the ocean. Um, that's how long it takes. And then they can come back, too. They have the power to do that. Pretty incredible. And this leads us to space, which will also be very important for defense in the future. We have other crazy things happening. SpaceX gets FAA approval for Starship ramp of a million plus orbital data AI centers. A lot of people that believe that data centers in space is never going to happen, but it is happening. And a lot of people believe it'll be 10 years out, 20 years out. No, they already have satellites in space that are solar powered. They just need to get bigger ones with more cooling and more solar powers, solar panels so they can run data centers in space. And now they got the machine to carry it all up there, the Starship, which will be flying again soon. This is happening. But to be able to get approval for a million launches, pretty incredible as well. Final piece, we got to enter the Orwellian center corner right now and talk about some of the other crazy stuff that's happening. GDP is up and the Feds Waller, he said he's never seen this economy growing like this without jobs. A lot of people think AI has no impact. Well, then somebody explained to me why GDP is growing without workers. or maybe the workers getting more productive because of AI. That is probably the theory that I think the US government is beginning to wake up to. And this will have a huge impact for interest rates because as productivity increases, GDP increases, deflation increases, inflation goes down, no need for high interest rates, rate cuts come down, and the market booms. All good. We shall see where it all leads. if AI is deflationary, which I believe it is. Also, this is um Open AI, Google, Anthropic, um they did a simulation. You notice Grock is not on this list, but they did a simulation of what would happen in a war game type situation and 95% of the results led to global thermonuclear war. There used to be a movie years ago called, I think it was War Games or something. Same thing. When you let the bad AI take control, they very quickly escalate into a thermonuclear war, which is no good for anybody. So hopefully firms like, again, going back to the Pentagon, pick the good AI and not let it run rampant because this could end in a very, very serious situation. Very serious indeed. And then Financial Times come out with this article too, boom, doom or modest growth. It's basically this AI what it could result in. It could result in end of scarcity, infinite abundance up to the top or we just chug along at 2% 0.2% growth per year or the Singularity takes over and everything stops. It's very weird. And then I ask, where did the Financial Times get this article from? Well, they found it here. And this was actually from the Federal Reserve Bank. The same people that were stunned here about never seen an economy grow like this, the Fed, Federal Reserve are now aware of AI and they're very much focused on it and they're simulating what could happen next, which is shocking to believe. With that, I'm just going to end. It's not really a meme dour. I've shared it once before, but I'll share it again. This is the very important thing is how everything is changing very fast. intelligence is going through the roof and the cost of intelligence is going to zero. Be prepared for that. That will have dramatic impacts over the next 5 years on us on this planet. And I want to say as well a big thank you. Sorry for it being a bit of a bit of a downer AI video, but these things need to be told. Thank you, Buck Horn. Thank you, AR, Ron, DBF, Bman, I am Colt, and of course our great mods, Shaun D, TND, Cyber Sniper, and K8. Thank you all for coming. Hope everybody's doing okay. Markets still suck, but you know what? Tomorrow's Friday, and Friday is up day, or I should be out of the midweek slump by now. And markets typically go up on Friday. So, let's see what happens. Hang in there, my friends. Um, you got to wait for more catalysts to take us to the next level. Right now, markets hate not knowing what's going to happen next. And AI is making everything very unsure. That's why nobody's willing to deploy. Everybody's sitting on their hands waiting for direction until something big happens. Need a big catalyst. And we're not seeing that on the horizon. But we're seeing other things on the horizon like we covered today. Thank you all for coming. Take care of yourselves. Bye.
