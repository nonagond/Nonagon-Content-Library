Kind: captions Language: en Anytime Anthropic releases a new software update, uh, market crashes, like they're like four for four at this point right now. So, break this down to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, guys, if you have not yet realized, AI is changing the world so rapidly that a mere post is going to change the entire economic landscape. On Monday, a blog post from Anthropic, not a product launch, not an earnings miss, a blog post wiped $31 billion off of IBM's market cap in a single trading session. That's the worst single day for the stock in 26 years. All because Anthropic said its AI can now do what armies of consultants used to charge a fortune for. IBM stock dropped 13.2% 2% closing at $223.35. That is the worst single day percentage drop since October of 2000 during the dot bust. And it's not an isolated hit. IBM has now fallen 27% in February alone, putting it on track for its worst month since 1968 when dinosaurs were roaming the earth. Here's why. An estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the United States still run on cobalt. a programming language developed in 1959. Hundreds of billions of lines of it run in production every single day. Banks, airlines, insurance companies, and federal government, all of it. If you've ever wondered why people are standing at a machine for like a half an hour to find like a simple answer to something, that's why it is running on these ridiculously antiquated machines. And for decades, IBM's dominance in the space was just protected by one simple fact. Cobalt was too complex, too old, too expensive for anyone to want to even touch. They'd rather just leave a legacy system that is that terrifyingly old. Now, the number of engineers who actually understand the Cobalt language shrinks every year. So, modernizing these systems actually gets harder every year, and it requires massive teams of consultants spending years mapping out the workflows. slow, painful, and for IBM, incredibly profitable. Anthropic saunters in and says they just flipped that equation. In their blog post, the company announced that Claude Code can now automate the exploration and analysis phases. And that's exactly what consumes most of the effort in Cobalt modernization. So now we're talking about mapping dependencies across thousands, millions of lines of code, documenting workflows, tracing execution paths, and identifying risks that would take human analysts months to surface. Anthropic claims teams can now modernize cobalt code bases in quarters instead of years. Given the radical shift of that, it wasn't just IBM that got hit by Claude's new upgrade. Accenture, Cognizant, both of them took hits because they also generate significant revenue from legacy systems being very difficult to modernize. The exact work Anthropic is claiming AI can now automate is what their entire business models are based on. Now, is the market overreacting with such a big swing? Maybe. IBM CEO Arind Krishna has pointed out that translating Cobalt code is only one step in an enormously complicated migration process. He says, "You still have to move the data layer, replace the middleware, re-engineer the integration points, and rebuild the disaster recovery infrastructure." This is the argument that I see from everybody, no matter what industry you're in. Gaming, for me, I see this all the time. My my fellow game developers, I love you guys and I totally understand the angst, but at the same time, however bad it looks today, it's only going to get better. And if you guys like the film industry, oh my god, I can only imagine what they're going through. Just watch the latest videos coming out. It grows more extraordinary by the day. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Please show this clip. People that want to complain about this are going to say that uh it's not perfect yet. But Drew Drew Drew, this isn't real. These pixels are predicted. They were not shot. When I say that looks exactly like Brad Pitt and that it looks in some shots, not every shot, but in some shots, it looks 100% real, like completely indistinguishable. It It is wild. This is three years after the most awkward thing was launched. &gt;&gt; Jeffrey Epstein is growing the Island Boys and Nick Fuentes in I don't know what that connection was, but &gt;&gt; it's uh yeah, there's there is uh some very bizarre undertones, but it's also it's therapeutic to see these action movie stars beating out of Jeffrey Epste. I won't lie, but I mean some of these shots, dude, they they are just completely indistinguishable. your brain just will not like even that when he's splashing in the water the water is physically accurate the way that it's splashing even in a video game Drew that is ridiculously difficult to pull off the amount of coding that you have to do to do something like that like now knowing as a game dev that oh AI I'm not going to have to create all these crazy shaders you're just going to put AI code that goes mimic how water reacts to this and it will just do it the whole point of this diet tribe is to get people to understand you have to look at where this is going look at the rate of change look at the rate of change like for the love of God, please. The rate of change is so fast. It It is just blinding. Where we've gone from 3 years ago till now is startling. Where we go in like 3 to five more years is just utterly transformative. The impact that that is going to have on industry is startling. You're going to hear a lot of CEOs talking about how, hey, this is no big deal. They still can't do this, that, or the other. There are people at these AI companies taking notes right now. every time you say, "Oh, this is the next thing that they would have to do before this is a real threat." And they're just like, "Yeah, Word, hold my beer." And they go and encode that. So much of this stuff is going to be an interface moment where it's not about the capabilities of the AI. It's simply about giving you the ability to access that little bit of control that you didn't previously have. And AI is going to learn all of this stuff, and it is going to get better so fast. So, what's the game plan? The game plan is not to try to knock what AI is doing. uh it's not to waste even a second saying well it's not capable of this that or the other. It is to build a time frame of when it's going to become capable of that thing to figure out how you're going to migrate your ability such that at a minimum you're the last person standing so that you've got a job all the way up until the technoutopia that we are all hoping is on the other side of whatever chaos is coming. But you want to master these things. And right now when I hear people like the CEO of IBM making their strong argument that IBM mainframes, for instance, aren't going anywhere overnight. Yeah, sure, fine. But they're going to eventually. And IBM just reported its highest mainframe revenue in 20 years last month. Sure. Okay, fine. But where's that going to go in a year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years? 5 years is a blink of an eye. Look, they're all trying to control the narrative. I get it. They're trying to assuage fears. I get it. But the reality is, if you're going to be playing in the marketplace, you've got to understand where all of this stuff goes. If people allow themselves to get sucked into that narrative, they are going to blind themselves to what is really going on. And what is really going on is that AI is going to change everything about how modern life works. And it's just a question of how fast. And so if you put your head down and don't plan for that, you're going to be in a dark place. So when they announced co-work co-work the SAS apocalypse happened teams was down 35% in it was down 34% 285 billion white agent teams was announced vibe working there was a broad software selloff IGF was down 30% code security then there was a cyber security crash was down octa network and uh crowdfund I think crowdsource was down eight um and now cobalt tool and then it's been IBM &gt;&gt; it's just going to keep happening you need to be building a mental model of where this stuff goes like build that mental al model. All of us, man, I think about this endlessly as somebody who runs a company. Where is this all going? How do I reposition things? How do I think about this from Impact Theory University's perspective? Obviously, we've pivoted everything over into our zero to founder, which is now essentially going to be AI for business. On the game development side, what are we doing there? How does that change my time horizons? How does that change what I believe to be possible? If you're not thinking about it, you will be the first run over by it. Thanks for watching this clip from the Tom Billu Show.
