Kind: captions Language: en Sarveves, you're one of my favorite SEOs. We are talking about Claude today and everybody in search engine optimization marketing tech on the world. No, but but really like it feels like it feels like recently everybody has been talking about Claude and you've been playing around a lot with with uh cloud co-work and you're going to be talking about how you're using it with SEO. This is going to be a very fun episode. Thank you again, Sarvesh, for joining. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for having me, Edward. And let me start this by saying that I haven't been as excited or as hyped up about anything recently than I am about Cloud Co cuz it's so magical. I mean, and I'll show you it in a bit. It It's just crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you're going to be for people if for people who are listening on Spotify Apple podcast Sarvesh will be sharing like everything on his screen in uh in a little bit. So he'll we'll we're going to try do our best to explain it over audio, but YouTube is going to be the real experience for this one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Watch it on YouTube more than anything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So why are you so excited? &gt;&gt; So Claude a few tools Claude has recently revealed which is Claude Code, Claude Co-work and then there's that uh that claude bot thing. The main difference is I I have not used cloud code a lot but cloud code is more for developers who are trying to code and write code stuff more like lovable. Claude co-work is basically an 24/7 assistant with you on your PC that can do things for you. So, so far Chad, GPT, Gemini, Claude, anyone you used to do like 50% of the work you have to, for example, if you have to do keyword research, you have to extract that data from Hrefs, upload into them, and then it does something for you. With this, you just basically tell it go do this for me and it will actually do that for you. So that is where it just makes it so so magical for especially for people who do not know like for business owners who do not have like SEO assistance with them and they they just want but still want to get it done. &gt;&gt; So I put together all of these use cases that I've used it for and just crazy. So &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there &gt;&gt; is it is it more readable now? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; Right. Uh so first I'll just quickly run you through what this particular prompt is going to do. So one one major problem that most business owners have is they they know their Google business profile is not fully optimized yet but they don't know exactly okay what do I do for that? This is going to make it so so simple that uh it's it's magical at that point. So what the prompt basically does is and by the way all of these prompts I've also used AI to give it a very detailed prompt. So it's AI working for AI at the moment. &gt;&gt; Working for Yeah. Yeah. For sure. But I mean I think everyone does that. &gt;&gt; AI AI writes better prompts than humans. &gt;&gt; True. 100%. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So let me show you actually uh what we are doing here is I've instructed claude co that you open crow you go to google maps and for example for plumbers New York you have to do all of these research. So you can just input any keyword for that matter. What it is primarily going to do is it will uh scan the Google maps listing, list the top five competitors and it will label them as their competitor and then for each competitor it will collect a lot of data and then it will also present you with exact findings and things that you need to do for your business. So instead of me going into the prompt, let's actually actually see an output. What I have done is I've actually done all of these tasks right before the call. So it does not take a lot of time in actually doing it because it does take like 10 15 minutes depending on how long the prompt is or how much sometimes it could also be done in like 2 minutes depending like I said depending on how long the prompt is. So you can see how it has worked. So it has it started with opening a Google uh map uh tab in Chrome then did all of the stuff that is there. Now let's actually see the final output that it has come up with and how useful it is this. So for lo for plumbers New York, it has put together a very competitive analysis report. These were the the top five sites that it found and what and it found out what what the primary category is for them. So one major issue that most uh local business owners have is okay, what should be my category? If I'm uh if I'm doing five different services, what should be my primary category if I want to rank uh more as a plumber? This just gives you that data that all of your top five ranking competitors have plumbumber category. Then it also does uh business identity signal. So it is looking at whether your competitors have keyword in their business name. If so, what keyword are they using, what their primary category is again. So if you are going to register um let's say a new business name, you know exactly that in order for you to rank in this space, you need to have that keyword in the business name. Now all of this obviously just till here for for a human to go out extract all of the primary categories for top five competitors uh analyze if if they're using a keyword this would take like 15 20 30 minutes to just compile all of that data and come back to all of this was done in few seconds by Lord Goa. Next is it is looking at okay where exactly the business is and what are their opening hours as well whether it's a physical or service area based business. So now you have the top five competitors and one thing very clearly you can see is out of top five top like four of them are open 24 hours. So then this is again a very great actionable point for you that you your business also needs to be open 24/7. Uh and at least it should be receiving calls for 24 hours if you want to rank in that Google business profile. Next this is again a very magical thing is it is going to just extract all of the reviews that there are. What is the total number of reviews? What is their average rating? How many fivestar? How many? So, and the do the review even have keywords in it and if so, which keywords are being mentioned a lot. Now, just to extract and actually compile this data for human could be multiple hours of work, right? Or you have to manually ex use any sort of extracting tool and then extract those uh those GBPs, reviews and and lot of work which just got done with one prompt by claude co-work on its own. After doing all of this, it is also looking at how complete their profile is. So it's looking at whether do they have a description, what have they filled all the services, what are their notable services, products, do they even have a book online button. So you get all of that data. Then it also goes out and and extracts all of their photos to see when did they upload the last photo, what kind of photo was it, do they also have videos? All of this data is presented to you in this table format. Next, &gt;&gt; this method of marketing is so effective, I had to make sure it wasn't against Google's rules before I kept doing it. It's a form of SEO I call compact keywords. Whereas most SEO focuses on putting up articles to answer questions, how, what, when. Compact keywords focuses on putting up dozens of pages that sell to searchers who are actually looking to buy. These pages rank on Google and convert so much better than normal that when I discovered this years ago, I couldn't believe this was allowed. It's less work, too. The average Compact Keywords page is only 415 words. Compact Keywords is a 13-hour deep course on getting sales with SEO. A customer recently said, "Each lesson is dense with information. You're giving years worth of experience boiled down into 15 to 30 minute lessons with no filler or fluff. I feel like I'm gaining a new superpower. Compact Keywords is about setting up an SEO funnel that brings you sales for years and years and years. It works with AI. It's less work than traditional SEO and it makes way more money. You can get it now at compactkeywords.com. Back to the podcast. &gt;&gt; Again, this is great is engagement. It is showing that are you are all of those your competitors posting Google profile post. when was the last post done? What was the post about? Do they have Q&amp;A? Do they have messaging? All of that data is again uh put it in here. Then trust and authority signals is now this is something where someone like uh an experienced SEO will be able to get that okay what are some extra things that they're doing. For example, this business is LGBTQ friendly. Uh the other ones are not. So if I were doing a a plumbing business and I wanted to rank, I definitely have this uh added to my Google business profile that I'm LGBTQ friendly. Now after getting all of this data, what we are asking Claude Kak to do is recognize the pattern among who are ranking and so this will give us a a good insight into why they are ranking. So now it is uh actually it's two things. So here it is it has done the full pattern recognition that all use plumber as primary category. So if if I want to rank as a plumber I'll also have to use primary category as plumber. I cannot use any other primary category. Number one has the most extensive secondary category coverage. This is also one thing that the the business that is ranking number one they're using eight different um secondary categories. So again I don't want to just read through everything but it is just going into so much details of everything and then it actually creates a ranking factor hypothesis just for this niche. So there's a difference between if you just ask Chad GPT or Gemini that okay what are the top five ranking factors for local SEO the list that it would give versus the list that has actually came out here could be very different because this is actually looking at your niche actually seeing what what is making those Google business profiles rank for this particular keyword. So now you know exactly okay I need to have review plus authority and one more thing we are seeing is RR plumbing has significantly more reviews than the others. So you need you know that okay in the next year or two I need to catch up with them if you want to dominate then keyword relevancy in name is also very very important that they have NYC or Manhattan in the keyword category relevance is also important and activity and freshness is also very important. So it's saying 1 to four have recent Google post within days or even hours. So uh and owner response to review visible on top performance photo recency is also 9 days for number one. So it exactly tells you what you need to do now that now it has done all of this and now it is waiting for the next &gt;&gt; before we go to the next instruction. Can you share your prompt for for how you got all of that? I think a lot of people will want to see the prompt that you used. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So it's this prompt and &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a very long prompt for like two three days. I I'll send this I'll send this across to you and you can just copy paste. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you have if you can give if you can give a a link for the for the doc and just have it open. Yeah. We'll put that in the &gt;&gt; And this is just one prompt by the way. I have like five more. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Really good ones. &gt;&gt; Great. Great. &gt;&gt; So now now you have a very good baseline setup for you that &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. How? So how how um cuz sometimes you know so can you scroll up a little bit? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it says it says ranking factor hypothesis. Um &gt;&gt; well sometimes sometimes correlation is not causation. So my question is how would you rate these uh these ranking factor hypotheses? Like what do you think of the of of its thoughts? Freshness. Well, category relevance very it's yeah it's very accurate &gt;&gt; and review is very important &gt;&gt; right so this is very accurate this is very accurate this is very accurate now number two and five is I would probably switch them around but why it has kept this as number two it has also given its uh reasoning here I think above I was reading it before uh it was saying that basically I'll just explain to you is the number two ranking uh one has less reviews than the number three one. So it was very apparent for it that because it was in that location the number two one it is it was being ranked number two by Google. But yes with anything AI take it with a grain of salt. But it's a great great starting point. So for any human to put this together even at our agency it to take probably one one day one full day to do this long analysis and come up with anything at all which just took like 10 minutes and and maybe few cents uh to to come up with everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amazing. &gt;&gt; And that is why I'm so uh excited and when you see it doing stuff it's also magical. So I I have basically loaded most of it but I'll also maybe do a live one and and and show the audience here. Now next thing is &gt;&gt; sorry go ahead. &gt;&gt; I know I said okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And then I have put together a more detailed uh uh prompt after just like a follow-up prompt is I'm asking it that for this particular keyword list what are the tops seven ranking levers Google's rewarding for this keyword and I'm also don't give me like generic SEO advice it has to be based only on the observed competitors and rank them by impact on rankings like highest to lowest. So this thing that you that we are seeing that hypothesis now it has actually refined it even more. So now you see review volume at scale is the number one factor according to to this uh cloud co-work in this space. Then the uh keyword in the business name like we all know if you have a if you have the keyword in the business name that's has a massive uh opportunity there but it solidifies that that yes now something like 24/7 availability signal it's saying that it is also a very important ranking factor in this niche. So if you didn't do this exercise fully, maybe you would see, okay, why do I need to be 24 available 24/7? If the competitors are doing it, let them do it. I I would just be available maybe 9 to5. But for your Google business profile to actually rank and dominate, this is you have to do this because four out of five competitors have listed themselves 24 open 24 hours. So you cannot actually rank without being open 24/7. If you especially if you're a new player then Manhattan core proximity is very important. So now it has given also like this thing secondary C category saturation. So it's saying RR plumbing has eight plus visible secondary categories also it has listed it. No other competitor shows this bread number two to number five display only plumber as visible category. So if if you ask me like any business okay how do I come up with like added advantage in ranking for Google business profile it is right here you see the number one ranking has all of these secondary ones all the other ones do not have it so if I were to to start I'd probably look into okay do I exactly provide any of these services if I do I'll just go ahead and add it for sure in my Google business profile and then Google post activity is also again it has as it is saying So like like I said, I mean again all of this to put together and give it as this is exactly what you buy as an SEO audit, right? You'd go and you pay an SEO agency and say do a Google business profile audit of mine and my competitors and this is what they would come up with maybe in in a in a few weeks and this is exactly what they would also come up with. So that is where I feel like something like cloud co-work just puts you in the position as a business owner that you never before because all you had to do was just give these prompts and just do your work what you were doing. Let it keep running on your system and you do not even need to come back and look at it at all and it will it will just finalize everything for you and then you can maybe get get all of this output in an Excel format or in a PDF whatever you like and you and more than that after this you can basically give it all of the access and you can just ask it to fix it and it will do that for you. So it's not even like I've gotten all of this data what do I do with it? This will actually go and execute it for you as well. Have you fact checked uh do Yeah, I'm sure you have. To what extent have you fact checked the information that cloud gets just to make sure there aren't hallucinations and and things are consistently correct? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was very correct in most cases like the number of reviews. Only thing I saw that was not ex 100% accurate maybe it was not able to extract that data was the photos one like uh it was not able to and and it didn't hallucinate. It did say I don't know. I was not able to to go through it. So you can just maybe run this part of the prompt again and see how well it does. But it is very accurate because when you see it doing stuff, you'll you'll know that okay why this is being done and you will see this there. It is actually doing it and not hallucinating it. &gt;&gt; And so you're using this in your agency right now or not yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. So uh I am just uh like I over the weekend I have been just setting up systems and everything and uh maybe tomorrow I'll be having a call with with all uh all hands on deck and I'll be just showing them around that now this because this will just speed up so many of our tasks because one SEO person it would have taken almost 5 6 hours to do just do this to come up to a point where we send an audit report to a client that see these are the things that needs to be changed these this is what your competitor is It used to take four five hours and this will be done on its own and then maybe yes the person can fact check stuff but you can also get cla again to fact check itself too. So just like AI &gt;&gt; and then and then you take this and you apply your branding to it to to present it really nicely. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. And and then you just go out and do the execution as well. You can actually ask it to help with the execution. So if you have the access to the Google b your Google business profile you just tell chrome that open business.google.com/loations and uh scroll to my xyz location change the prim uh then click on edit and and just change the primary category to this it will do it for you that is the main difference like with any other AI they will just tell you okay go do this now click on this click on this this will actually do it for you &gt;&gt; that's great dude I love I I love I love your enthusiasm, man. I It's uh like Yeah, it's it's awesome and the depth of this report is so cool. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I mean I even I was surprised because it just say it will just save me also a lot of cost time and and it will make the execution also really fast for everyone that even for agencies just putting together this report is a lot of work which could be now done very quickly and then you use your SEO brain to make sure everything is right and all of that but just the basic work can be done so so quickly now that yeah it will it will be magical for for the agency as well. &gt;&gt; Amazing. And so so this is one. Now let me show you uh another one that we are doing. It's complete onpage SEO audit of any page for that matter. So the prompt basically tells it that it is a senior on page SEO editor and we are going to input pages and and tell tell it the primary keyword for that page and then it will present uh present you with a lot of data again. So let's see how it did. So I I just randomly pulled up any site. It was right plumbing NYC. And the primary keyword is plumber New York for them. Now I just gave all of this and I basically went to sleep and it it did everything on itself. And you can see how it's doing like first it's it it went there and loaded the page. Then uh it it tried to capture a screenshot. Then every step now it is trying to read the page source to extract technical elements. And if you uh click on this, it also says that it was able to read the page. Now it it got the technical SEO elements. It every step it did. And finally, it presents to you with the on page SEO audit report. Now for this particular URL, it's saying it uh I I've asked it for five like a bullet point summary of of big wins and big problems that are there. So big win was that yes, you have a lot of good uh reviews and all of that. big problem is that it is not using plumber New York as the keyword here. It's using plumbing NYC. But if if you let's say if you want to rank mainly for plumber New York more than anything like plum more than plumbing NYC I'm sure generally people would search for plumbumber or plumbers and the city not plumbing at the city but yeah maybe we can take a look at the data. So it just it saw it and it it very quickly flagged that out. Another thing it flagged very quickly is it's missing local business schema. It has generic organization web page schema and all of that but it is missing local business schema. Then it also did page speed inside test for me and then it it showed that it needs improvement and images have are missing all text. Now I have what I've done asked is to put all of the findings in a table. So for example title tag was this and it is saying that it needs improvement and why it matters is also explained. So now let's say from an agency point of view, you do not even need to explain it to your client. You just send this report and they have everything that they need to understand why this is not working or why this needs a change. Similarly, H1 element is wrong. Uh uh it it's not saying plumber right now. So if if plumber New York was your main keyword, that is what it it should use. Then hierarchy is also saying it has uh uh they want the phone number is is incorrectly marked as an H2 like like these are very small on pages errors that I see across audit for most businesses that their H2 would be like a phone number which does not make sense to be kept as an H2 all of that and so and similarly uh nap consistency checked and it it is saying that it it is consistent then it's not mentioning any city or neighborhood there. So that it checked and it is saying that this is priority one needs to be fixed because they are not mentioning any nearby towns or or locations on their page. &gt;&gt; So all of that I mean I don't want to bore you with with each step but you can see you can see how well it has and it has also given priority P 0 P1 P2 on how you have to execute. Then I've asked it to put together an action step. So okay very well you've given me all of that data but now put together an accent step for me. So it it also went ahead and and it has it has rewrote it rewrote the H1 to be this and it's it's saying that the impact would be high. Then it has also given like add add this local business schema fix all of the missing anchor tech uh um image or text how do you how do you optimize the uh speed loading all of that. As you can see, it's so such a detailed thing and what is the best thing is that I can just give you it has given you the exact schema all of that and if you do not know how to do it, you can basically give it WordPress access and just tell it go to writeplumbingnenyc.com/wpadmin login using these credentials. It will login for you and then it will actually go ahead and and maybe install a plug-in to add this command. It will actually do it for you right from here. So any page you throw at &gt;&gt; but do a backup before you do that &gt;&gt; 100%. Yeah, &gt;&gt; and if it's not ranking for anything, well ain't good anyways. &gt;&gt; But yeah, like I said, I mean, uh, keep a check on it. Obviously, it's AI, so there could always be hallucination or things on those lines. But yes, I most of it is very accurate because I did check uh manually. I checked the the meta title and H1 of the page and it was it is exactly what it was saying uh that Claude Co was saying. So that's that's it. It is mostly accurate but again with anything AI keep a check for sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so so this is a very detailed prompt we are using for that on page. I'll send that over as well. Then there is schema audit. Next thing we did was for any uh business for that matter. I have just given it this prompt that I this is my business and I want to open the page. Look at all of the schemas there are there on that page. Tell me what schemas are missing. give me all of that schema. So if if you do that in on page SEO audit, it will automatically anyways give you that those schema. But if you just want to do the schema audit, it will give you all of those schemas as well in very in after writing everything and then uh you can just basically copy copy paste and get it live on the site or you can ask again cloud co to do it for you. So these are few things and these are just few things that we can I mean it just opens up so many possibility. The way I was also also doing it is uh I can show you um about researching top roofers and it it will go to Google maps. It will type that keyword. It will find all of the business profiles do everything for you. It can also if you have any SEO tool for that matter for example uh if you have HS Uber suggest it will log to you for that and actually do all of that. So for example I I told it here that go to HS keyword explorer and for the keyword roofer New York open the first site and that is a business not a directory. So it it also understands very clearly that okay only open the site that is a business and it's not a Yelp or anything and then I've opened as it opened the page that is ranking do a quick on page like this is a very basic prompt but it actually opened HS did all of that work for for me and and gave me all of that report. So now I gave it a random another one I said do a complete on page SEO audit for me and tell me five things I'm doing right and five things I'm doing wrong. So the like I said the the brilliance of it is it will actually do stuff for you. And one last thing I' I've prepared uh is for the rankability of any page like I I'm just ask it this is a page this is my site I wanted to open Chrome go to Google and and search for the target keyword which is uh again plumber New York and then look at other sites and compare it with my page. So it it pulled up these three organic results from Google search and then it has compared it to top lumber NYC and it is saying and it is giving like what are the things that we are not doing what are doing and why and it then gave a verdict that we deserve to rank lower because these are the few things that we do not have and is also just giving me a very straightforward action items that do do these few things and you'll see see more improvement in ranking. So even if you do not have a lot of SEO experience, just fixing these things itself can give you a good uh ranking boost. Uh overall, &gt;&gt; how did you set it up? &gt;&gt; It was very simple. Uh basically I I go I went to claude co-work and down and there was an option to download especially for Mac and Windows. I think both was there. So uh you go to claude and from here uh I think it was this only from introducing co-work I I went to the download link &gt;&gt; and then what is flawed only. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it it needs a few permissions especially uh it it installs uh something in Chrome for for for it to do all of that work for you. So and one more thing is every time it accesses a new website you'll have to allow that access. So it's not like full access all the time for it. Once you allow that access then only it's able to do it. So for example &gt;&gt; I mean a website that requires login access. &gt;&gt; No for it to access Chrome like any new website. For example, if I'm opening your website and I want it to do something some analysis on that it it will require a separate permission from you that I am going to access this site. Can I access it? And then you allow then only that happens. Oh, just to so so if you're actually doing competitive if you're like looking through a SER because like so like let's just say 10 results in a SER it has to ask you for permission 10 times to go and look at each website. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ah &gt;&gt; yeah that is that is one problem right now is uh and I maybe they'll solve this with some update or I don't know if this is exactly the way it is built but yeah that also gives you more control on so once you at you have to just give it give that permission one time like I've given the permission for anything to do on hs and it will just it then it will not ask you for any permissions for that site but the moment &gt;&gt; when I was watching I'm like I'm like oh yeah this would be great for it to go actually like do analysis of a cuz like you have all of your keywords &gt;&gt; and I I I still would still prefer to do keyword research myself like find the keywords but if you have a list of keywords and you could say look at this SER figure out the SERs that where the keyword is not being properly optimized for and then go and actually click into in the keywords that look like they're not properly or maybe keywords that look like they're just like you're not sure. go into the actual pages and see if the pages satisfy search intent properly and uh yeah that would be that would be a very cool thing to automate &gt;&gt; actually uh so I what I tried was let's let's do this together so I'll ask it to open h open chrome go to hrefs uh and I think let me just put it the put the keyword explorer uh directly here go to and then let's do maybe uh do the search for give me just a any random keyword for that matter anything broad. Uh &gt;&gt; okay standing desks for offices. &gt;&gt; So so let let's just do standing desk for example. And next is find uh find out or basically just scroll to the questions section. Open it and find me five questions that people are asking. But there must be a DR10 site ranking for it. uh the I'll just prompt it more that there is an option uh at the top that says lowest DR. I'm not sure if it it will automatically do it but I'm just giving it uh the prompt. So let's see now I've I've given it and it will start an a agent. It will uh just sending request and &gt;&gt; we're just playing around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is how it is using. You can see with the yellow thing that that is how it's being warm. It's now going on its own and it will so let me just pull this up as well simultaneously so we can see. &gt;&gt; Oh, nice. &gt;&gt; It's now sent &gt;&gt; it's now sending a request. So go there and it will &gt;&gt; while it's doing this I I want to know. So you said you're doing um a like all hands-on. You said tomorrow or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How like um aside from what you just showed us, what will you what are you going to tell your team? &gt;&gt; Few different things. So the the content that is being uh generated by content writers, they have to do so before the content is generated the SEO team has to put uh to put together an a brief for that content. Now for creating that brief, they have to go to multiple URLs do extract all of their heading. So it's a few different steps that they have to take which can be done by claude coowork automatically and you can see it now here it has already clicked on lowdr and it will just type in uh I think we have given 10 right so it should it it will type in 10 there and it will click on apply it will do everything itself so yeah sorry to come back to your question that back links could be magical there because the back links uh we have to do a lot of filtering of the website so we can just tell it go look open this site in in keywords in site explorer. Look at the traffic graph. If it is going down massively, skip that site. If it is not, look at what organic keywords they're ranking for. So all all of the things that basically human is doing can be sped up very quickly and then you can do random checks or you can do things on those lines. So now it has you can see for yourself, right? Something that a human would have done, it has already done it and now it will also give everything to you uh in in a format. So you can see it already came up with five like eight questions that has a a very low DRI ranking for it. So you can just go ahead and create a really good uh blog around it and and just rank for it. &gt;&gt; Awesome. And and so wait you were saying you were sharing what you were going to be telling your team. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh uh right so what I'm going what we'll be going uh be doing is try to automate a lot of the the stuff that needs a lot of manual work hours. Uh so I was saying yeah the back links the content side of things anything the audits take us a lot of time even uh like Google business profile uh side of things replying to reviews also would be would be great because uh what it can do is it can just periodically every few hours scan the Google business profile and and see what new reviews has come in and it can then follow the whole uh SOP and automatically reply to those reviews without you need to be actually doing anything. &gt;&gt; So a few different things. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I mean anything that the human can do is almost possible now with this. &gt;&gt; So because it is going to use the system as a human basically. &gt;&gt; What are the things that are most annoying using it right now? &gt;&gt; The the credit limit is is really shitty for the pro plan. So I started with the pro plan which was 20 bucks a month around around that and it hit the limit very quickly. So it was not very uh uh high limit for the pro plan. So I since shifted to max plan it has a decent enough I mean I haven't hit the limits yet. So I'm assuming it has like five five to 10 times more more credit limit than the normal one. There's the $200 plan which has like 20 times more of the of the $20 plan is what they are saying. So if you if you're a heavy user of it that that would be the best option. And yeah one more thing is like this is just SEO stuff that we are talking about so far. This can do any work for you like it because we are just talking about SEO. It is not an SEO tool. It could literally do anything and everything for you. So, uh, any &gt;&gt; I want to I want to ask because so it needs I'm I'm I'm not I want to just make sure I'm getting it right. It needs permission to go into any website even if it's just viewing the homepage. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh, let's actually do that. Maybe for example, &gt;&gt; because like if you wanted to actually do some sort of research while you sleep, it can't it I &gt;&gt; So, let's actually try it out. Like for example, I've not opened the verge.com at all. So I I'll show you how how it it gives a prompt. So it will now &gt;&gt; uh it's going to send a request. &gt;&gt; Okay. Perform and we can see it. &gt;&gt; It has opened the new term. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It has opened the Yeah. So this is how it will show like claude wants to navigate to this and once you do always allow actions on this site after that it will just do everything. But for this this it will it will ask you for this permission. So I mean maybe claw should actually think about I I the whole permission. Yeah always allow something on those lines but that is not there right now for for the time being. &gt;&gt; Have you looked into settings? &gt;&gt; I have not actually maybe maybe they already have an option. Let's yeah let's see. So, if I go to settings, uh maybe capabilities, &gt;&gt; memory skills, &gt;&gt; I'm sure someone in the comments is going to let us know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Uh so, desktop app general. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, probably I'll have to find that out. Let's I just let's ask this uh uh can I auto permission for opening any site to to plot co instead of uh manually allowing each site. Let's see how what it says. Are there any other um are there any other like SEO methods that you do maybe different than other SEOs that you're excited to automate with Claude? &gt;&gt; That's a good question. uh haven't really I mean thought about this in terms of difference but uh uh but at least anything and everything that you do manually can be done by this. So anything maybe and this needs more uh more looking into at my part that what are the things that we do maybe differently or or things on those lines. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just you just started playing playing around with it and I'm and I'm like oh man Serveves is is loving this. let's get him on the podcast to talk about it and like and this is exactly what I wanted. So I like I'm super hyped that you did this &gt;&gt; and it's actually saying currently there isn't a setting to give blanket permission but yeah if yeah so so that it does need the that initial uh thing. So yeah, maybe it's not fully automatic yet, but in future, I mean, it's just one update away whenever cloud co-work does this. &gt;&gt; But yeah, that that is the current situation that if you open a new site for for it to actually do any uh action on it, you need to allow it once and just select like always allow for that site. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it also shows here that the cloud is active in this group. And you you can open the chat from here. And uh just by this line you can understand that you see uh when I was last time looking at it, it was it's actually doing the on page SEO audit for us. If if correct &gt;&gt; the very least it can look through SERs and find lowhanging fruit SERs just looking at page titles and URL slugs &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; everything. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and and the snippets, it can it can still it can still probably do a a like somewhat sufficient job at finding lowhanging fruit keywords, &gt;&gt; right? So, one thing, one important thing is that this is not like a new AI or anything. It still does the same thing that Chad, GP, applaud were doing, but the difference is for you to actually come up with everything, you had to do all of the basic research and then give it to to Chad GPT for it to make sense. That is eliminated here that now this can do it itself and present you with everything and then it can actually go ahead and execute that for you as well. So maybe one thing I'm I'm uh kind of thinking about is uh also giving and yeah this is it's a double-edged sword and giving it access to to your emails and stuff. So it can also act as a as a full VA for that matter. Yeah, a lot of people are I mean I I was talking with Ram Barowette, my one of my business partners before this call and Ram has been on the show before as well and yeah Ram was Ram was telling me about all of that and Ram is going to come on the show and and show some cloud stuff too and he was saying that he's so excited like everyone's talking about everyone is talking about this. &gt;&gt; True true viral. &gt;&gt; I just actually did Yeah. I I mean I did a thread on claude coowork just today and it it's just going crazy viral. I mean people are actually actively look looking for it. It uh it's this one and it cla is a literal cheat code for SEO and it's been about four five hours of just growing. &gt;&gt; I could take any local service business to $100,000 a month in 90 days using just cloud co-work. Here is exactly how I do it. Oh man, you know what I would &gt;&gt; and it has all of the prompts, everything. So actually there's this stuff. &gt;&gt; Dude, you come up with the greatest hooks as well. &gt;&gt; Like I love sharing your stuff on the show because it's like it's always going to be fire, &gt;&gt; right? And that is why I've been so excited about just using this. I mean, I I have haven't slept in like 2 days and I I just I'm up till like 3:00 a.m. and just exploring what what else can I do? It's more about like coming up with ideas where okay, where can I just make it replace me and just do that work for me. So that is all I'm just doing right now. Mostly SEO. That was me last last week when when uh DIG relaunched and I was up until 3:00 a.m. And then and so what I did is I just shouted my loud mouth all over X and the post went like pretty viral and then uh and then Dig were like we we're going to like basically first of all we're going to focus on anybody who has talked about using Dig for parasite SEO. Anybody and of course I was on that list. So they they killed like all of my accounts, all of my communities and and then they went after like just the broader SEO communities as a whole and and after SEOs as a whole. But but that was me that that was me last week with Dig was like I I know I should sleep. It's 3:00 a.m. I got to create another community. I got to open another account. &gt;&gt; True. And that's that's exactly I'm I'm at right now. I'm just exploring everything. But &gt;&gt; what else can I do with what else can I automate? I got to I'm going to automate this thing. I'm going to automate this thing. It's You know what? Actually, I've been watching Dude, I don't know if you ever seen this. I've been watching on TikTok people get 3D printers and then they just go down this like rabbit hole of trying to 3D print literally everything and including things that they don't even need to 3D print. I I don't need Oh, I don't need like a a couch holder for my for my phone, but I'm going to 3D print it anyway. Like &gt;&gt; I already have like 10 combs. I'm going to 3D print 15 more. &gt;&gt; Same when you get like an air fryer, you you just want to air fry everything to see, okay, how how it does how it turns out. &gt;&gt; Yo, let's automate everything. We got to automate everything. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm just in that phase and it's like &gt;&gt; it's 5:00 a.m. and and I'm like &gt;&gt; and I'm automating &gt;&gt; and I am it's like 1:00 a.m. already and I'm I'm still going. It's literally 1:00 a.m. It's literally 1:00 a.m. for you &gt;&gt; and and just yapping about co all right now. &gt;&gt; Oh man, Saresh, thank you so much for coming on the show and for sharing all of this and I love having you on and I'm looking forward to the next one. &gt;&gt; I just love the show.
