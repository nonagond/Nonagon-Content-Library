So father asked me to talk about the levels of spiritual warfare and our lady's view of our times and they are somewhat connected. You know, a lot of times people ask me because I'm an exorcist, they say, 'Father, do you think things are getting worse? And I'm like, well, some things are kind of obvious. You know, you don't have to necessar I mean, you don't have to be an exorcist to see that things are getting particularly bad. Some people will say, well, things have not there. It's the same kind of stuff, so things aren't really getting that bad. That's true in one sense, in the sense that there's nothing new under the sun. But on the other hand, it is a fact that it does, if you look at the state of the world, things are getting particularly bad because people have kind of lost their way. They're not even acting according to the natural law. But there's also, as we'll see when we get to our lady's view of our times, there is in fact a discussion by our lady in certain apparitions where she talks about how demons are going to gain extraordinary power later. And that's of course it seems to be happening in our times. One of the ways that we actually know that demons are becoming more powerful is we actually keep statistics in our community because I've been doing exorcisms for about solemn exorcisms for uh uh 15 years and I've been doing regular uh exu uh other exorcisms minor exorcisms for about 17 years. And so we started keeping statistics and what we started to notice is that in relationship to possession where demons actually possess people the number of possessions is statistically remaining the same. It's 0.5% of the general population 5%. So one out of every 200 people is likely possessed. And those people that come to us it's about that same statistic. Then if you actually look at the I'm going to do something with these mics here. Okay. And if you actually look at the number of people that have become diabolically obsessed, which I'm going to talk about, &gt;&gt; right? Okay. &gt;&gt; So, when I talk about diabolic obsession, the statistic has drastically changed. Good. I'm glad you can hear me. This is what you get for being vertically challenged. All right. People always say, you know, when I hear you on YouTube and then I see you in real life, I thought you were like six foot tall. And I'm like, yeah, that's the beauty of YouTube. All right. But statistically, when you're talking about diabolic obsession, that the amount of rates of diabolic obsession are drastically on the rise. When you talk to exorcists, what they're finding out is that the statistical number, the average, I pulled several of the top exorcists in this country. And I asked them, what percentage of you do you think of the adult population in this country is diabolically obsessed? which I'll talk about in a minute. Every single one of us came up with the same statistic, 25%. Diabolic oppression is also on the rise, but for different causes. Diabolic oppression is also on the rise. We figure that the average the average number of people that are being diabolically oppressed is somewhere between 10 and 15%. The di of the population is diabolically oppressed. It's an indicator that the uh that the diabolic influence is drastically increasing and it's increasing for a variety of different reasons. It's increasing because people are doing a lot of evil things. Every mortal sin, this is something I tell people, every mortal sin is an open door to possession. In fact, mortal sin by its nature takes it the person out from underneath the authority structure of God and places it the person underneath the authority structure of Satan. The proper effect of of mortal sin is possession. Now that doesn't mean that everybody who commits a mortal sin becomes possessed because even though the person opens the door, God is the one who determines whether the demon gets to step across the threshold. And so that means that by the mercy of God, most people who commit mortal sin do not become possessed. But the number of evil things that people are doing is opening up the door to demons getting more influence in this life. Then of course there's the increase in the occult. We're seeing this all over the place. The amount of occult material, the occult activity that's going is drastically on the increase. And as Exorcist, we're seeing it across the board. The other thing that we're seeing is when I first started doing exorcism, but let's just back up. Before 1963, the average time to liberate someone from full possession was one to two days. Average time, maybe a week on the outside. The case down that originally started out here on the East Coast, but ended up in St. Louis that took 59 days was practically unheard of. That's what was so shocking. It took that long. After 1963, what used to take one to two days went to eight months to two years to liberate the average person. Then it's now on average four years to liberate somebody. There's two reasons for that. One is because the world is much more evil and the demons are a lot more powerful. The second component is is that exorcisms work what they call exopereoparant ecclesia. What does that mean? It means how holy the people are in the Catholic Church determines how effective my prayers are when I walk into session. That tells us that there's a fundamental problem with the the members of the church. They're not as holy as their counterparts were in the past. So what we want to do is we want to talk about these levels of warfare and then also our lady's view of what's actually going on. And then I want to end it with how we can actually address this to some degree. So you actually looked every there's actually technically there's seven different kinds of diabolic influence. The seventh one is actually when they infest buildings and things of that sort. So we're not going to go much into that, but we want to talk about how they affect us specifically as human beings. The first is by ordinary temptation. Every single individual that's ever lived has been subject to ordinary temptation. All of us are and there's varying degrees of temptation. In fact, you can actually find out what virtue God wants you to perfect by the temptations that he allows the demons to cause in your in your life. And the reason being is because in heaven there's only two human there's a human nature and a human being that has the plenitude of all the virtues. That's our Lord and our Lady. Everyone else has varying degrees of virtue. And the reason they have varying degrees of virtue is because God likes variety. And the way we know God likes variety is all you have to do is look at the number of different kinds of bugs there are in this planet. And you know he likes variety. Okay? And in heaven, part of the beauty is that there's this massive variety that has a certain kind of uh concert aspect to it. And that's what the beauty of it actually is. And so everybody and so what that means is that everybody there's a particular virtue or set of virtues that God wants you to become proficient. Now he wants you to have all of them but he wants you to excel specifically in certain areas. And this is why he allows people to be tempted in those areas because when we are tempted by the diabolic it's a it's a stronger struggle that's required. And so the level of virtue we reach is higher than if we're just doing it on our own. This is one of the principal reasons that God allows demons in our lives is to sanctify us. Because when we combat them and become instruments of justice to them, what happens is is that that is meritorious in the eyes of God and it actually raises our place in heaven. St. Paul said it, engage the ancient serpent and win the crown of glory. Right? So we actually know that it's actually in engaging in spiritual combat is one of the ways in which we can actually raise our place in heaven. And so this is one of the reasons why we have to realize if when demons are attacking it's not something in which we should feel sorry for ourselves. It's just a recognition of okay this area that this guy keeps attacking me that's the area that I need to become proficient in. And you'll reach a level of virtue which will excel and then you'll be known in heaven for that because in heaven you take two things with you. your state of grace, how much grace you have in your soul and your virtue. That's all you take and that's what everybody sees in you in heaven. So God allows the spiritual warfare for our purification. He allows the temptations for our purification and for our growth and also self-nowledge where we're tempted a lot of times is where our weakness is. But demons can do that because they can introduce things into our imagination and they can move our emotions. This is why in the entire history of Catholic theology, in its entire history of spiritual theology, every single saint has warned against following our emotions in our spiritual life. Because as my assistant says, God's not the only one who broadcasts on that channel. The fact is is that demons can manipulate our emotions. And if you're in the habit of following your emotions, then basically you are under their direction. This is why we have to follow reason illuminated by faith. So he allows us to suffer these things so that we begin to get our emotions under control, be gain virtue, and then it purifies us. And this means that demons are the instruments of our sanctification and purification. So sanctified perfection. You might have heard me talk about this when I was with Cardinal Burke. Sanctified perfection is excellence in grace. It means you have a lot of sanctifying grace. And sanctifying grace is the is the created participation in divine nature that God infuses in our souls. And so the holer you become, the more of that you actually have. Well, how do you become holy? How do you get more of that? It's through the exercise of the acts that pertain to virtue. So as you grow in virtue and you do these for supernatural intentions, you're offering things up etc. Your sanctity begins to grow and this means that the demons in combating them, it's a struggle. It's a fight. We know God loves a good fight. We know he does. And part of the reason we know it is because of the fact that since the time of Adam and Eve, when Adam and Eve ate the fruit in the garden, they stepped out again from the authority structure of God and stepped underneath the the power structure of Satan. From that point on, every single one of us was conscripted into the spiritual warfare. There's different degrees by which we experience that. Obviously, you're not going to have the same experience I do in dealing with people who are possessed. But you are going to experience it to some degree. And how much he wants you to experience that is not a sign that he's abandoning you. In fact, the more God allows the demons into your life, there's a conccommittent amount of grace he's going to give to you to combat it if you're faithful. And if you're faithful, that means that the more the demons are in your life. Now, I'm not suggesting you invite them in. But the more they're in your life, that means the more he wants you to achieve holiness, to ex achieve excellence in grace, excellence in virtue, and to have that crown of glory of having defeated those demons and been the instrument of their of their justice. God wants to punish them because it's proportionate to what they've done. Any demon in session, that is when we're doing solemn exorcisms over people possessed, will admit that there is no punishment that God could ever meet out on them to which would ever be commensurate with how evil they are and that the sin that they committed. So we're instruments of their justice. And this first starts in relationship to temptation. The next So this is ordinary. The next five are extraordinary forms of temptation. So these are the levels of spiritual warfare that we actually engage in versus just temptation. But the next one is called doore in Latin. It means pain. But basically it's the prerogative of saints. I've never met an authentic case. I mentioned that once in a YouTube thing and some woman wrote me, "Hey father, I'm an authentic case." Then you start digging in and find out no she's not that good. It's the prerogative of saints. It's when the demons because the person no longer needs purification, the normal temptations and stuff don't work. And so God allows the demons to physically acost them. This is what happened to Padre Peio. It happened to Paul of the Cross. It's even it even even happens. It's right in scripture. It happened to St. Paul. It happened to St. John Viani where they would physically beat them. And so this is things where the demon allows it, but it's done for the demon's humiliation, but it's also done to increase again the virtue of the one that has this is it's like I said, it's the prerogative of saints. So you're unlikely to have it unless you're a saint. I, you know, one of the beauties of being able to stand up here and say, "Nobody in this church is a saint." And people say, "Well, you can't say that, Father." Well, here's the thing. If you're not a saint, you're going to admit, "Yeah, I'm not a saint." If you're a saint, you're not going to think you're a saint. So, you're going to say, "Yeah, I'm not a saint." So, I got you covered. All right. The next one is oppression. This is when demons attack us from the outside. This is when they attack our finances, both inflows and outflows. They can cause stuff to constantly be breaking and you're just getting bled financially. They can affect your relationships where things just all of a sudden go off the rails. This is what we tend to see a lot in families. In fact, one of the ways that we actually know that diabolic influence is increasing is that the number of good families, I'm going to talk about this a little bit later. The number of good families who are under brutal attack are is drastically on the increase in the last two years. The second, so they they can also affect your health, your job situation. They can attack the demons, God permitting, can attack this. Why does God allow it? And all of the saints basically [snorts] say and all of the spiritual writers who deal with this and the exorcists who are experienced say it's because by the demons attacking you only have one recourse to solve this problem. You have to get closer to God. And so it's to draw God allows it to draw you closer to him. And so they always said that the way that you overcame diabolic oppression was an increase in your prayer life specifically. And as they did that it would slowly taper off. For the longest time, exorcists never knew was there ever a s silver bullet that would actually cause a sessation of oppression and it never came around. Well, I had this one case where this demon said, "Well, you're never going to break this case until you break the oppression." And I thought, "Well, then I'm going to beat out of this guy what it takes to break oppression." The three most brutal days of session I've ever had was over that one issue. This guy did not want to give this piece of information up. into the third day he finally started coughing it up and he says okay look it it's like any other right I'm like what do you mean and he just looks at me like I'm stupid I'm like humor me and so he says you have to ex uh it's like any other right we're God doesn't give us rights over your property he only gives us permission to attack them and so if you exercise your rights we do this instinctively of as human beings if someone's attacking our property that's physical What's our first thing we do? We exclaim, "Hey, that's my property." And that's basically what we do with the demons. We have to tell, we have to command them that this is our property and we can command them to leave. And he said, "If you do it in the state of grace and you're forceful and you keep doing it, we'll leave." So, we drafted a prayer. It worked. But then it was like who them all. He was going from thing to thing. And I'm like, I'm tired of this. So, I beat out of him. How do you stop that? And he said something very interesting. He said that as long as you retain the rights over your property, Christ will always give us a certain amount of access to them. But if you consecrate them to our lady and give them entirely to her. Now, it doesn't mean you don't take care of your property and you're not the steward of it, but he said once she accepts it, Christ forbids us to touch it. This is pretty serious. So, we drafted a prayer based on St. Lewis be drawn for its total consecration, but we narrowed it down to that and we found that it actually wipes out about 80% of oppression if people do it consistently every day and they're very specific about the target. That is, they're naming the thing in the prayer that the demons are oppressing. But oppression, remember, is something that God wants to draw you closer to him. So, there's personal oppression, but then there's also what's called societal oppression. This is when all of us who are trying to lead good Catholic lives, trying to lead virtuous lives, trying to be good people have to suffer the diabolic influence in other people's lives who are doing evil things and it's affecting us. This is drastically on the increase. This is why I don't know if you've noticed, but it seems almost that as time goes on, there's a slow building of a heaviness and dealing with all of just just the the garbage that we're constantly dealing with. The next is diabolic obsession. This is when demons attack the psychological faculties. But unlike the ordinary temptation which where they attack the imagination and the emotions, they do that same thing in obsession where they attack the imagination and the emotions, but it's so strong and powerful that the person has a they're practically incapable of fighting the thing off. They're incapable of dealing with it. And so what we have to tell people like that is that you your job in that particular case is not to think it through. You're not going to get clarity in those moments because you're under attack. Demons do this thing called running commentary. Once they put something in your head, if you try and start reasoning with it, they keep putting other stuff in your head and it doesn't matter what you do over the course of time. You just never climb your way out of it. So you have to stop thinking about it and you have to fall into fight mode. You have to go after them and you have to combat them. And there's specific things that that deal with different kinds of obsession. But once they start doing that, then what'll happen is is that they'll actually start experiencing longer periods of lucidity. One of the ways that you can actually discern diabolic obsession from psychological obsession. The psychological obsession is actually the result of a set of mental habits. It's habits. It's patterns of thinking that people have gotten into through rumination through long periods of time. And as a result, if you pray over somebody like that, there's no change because it's a set of habits. And it tends to be very consistent and it tends to correlate to external stimuli, right? So when somebody says something, they react. Whereas diabolic obsession and so it's very consistent. Whereas diabolic obsession doesn't do that. It switches on and it switches off and there's no external reason for it. The person will just wake up in the morning and all of a sudden boom, they're just angry. And then an hour and a half later, boom, it just lifts and they're just like, I don't know what happened there. Right? And so this is one of the signs is that but that time in which they're not attacking the person, how long that is tells you how strong of diabolic obsession that they actually have. So if they don't have very long periods of lucidity, that's an indicator that they're starting to approach possession because it's a gamut. these diabolic forms of influence. People can become so obsessed that eventually the demons drive them to do something that causes them to become possessed. So this is an indicator that that and as you start praying, as the person starts praying and doing the combat, those periods of city get longer and longer and longer and then it reaches a certain kind of threshold where it seems like the demon's gone. They might have one or two really bad attacks and then as long as they maintain their prayer life, it's over. The diabolic obsession. So they did a statistic and I'm not saying there's a one to one correspondence but it's very interesting this statistic. Three years ago they did a poll of college age students between 18 and 22 and they asked them how many of you are currently or have seen a psychologist 22%. This is an indicator that the the diabolic obsession rate of 25% is probably pretty close. And I'm not suggesting that every type of psychological problem is diabolic. Quite the contrary. If you look at how psychology relates to the diabolic, it's three-fold. Some people are just nuts. And they're just crazy. Some people it's psychiatric. So I had one guy come to me and he his mother was absolutely convinced he was possessed because he was hearing voices. That doesn't mean anything. And then I told him, I want the guy's medical makeups. So they sent me the medical makeups. And there it was right there. Drug induced psychosis. the guy had smoked marijuana ended up now with psychosis which is not an uncommon thing. It's on the rise in fact. And part of the reason is too is and I asked him, "Well, you're hearing voices." Yeah. Well, what are they saying? I said, "Well, what do they sound like first?" And he said, "They sound like George Bush and Ronald Reagan." Okay. Well, what are they telling you? Vote Republican. I don't think demons are going to be wasting their time with that. Right. And so, and I prayed over the guy. No change. Right. But the point being is that it's it's entirely organic or natural is the problem. Then there's th those which are entirely diabolic. So I'm working with a woman right now that when she is lucid, when the demons aren't attacking her, she is as rational and as normal as anybody here. She's just completely normal. When the demons attack her, then she fights and then she's got issues. But but during that time, she's completely normal. Those aren't too common. Most of them are an intermix between psychological issues and demons layered on top of it because there can be a mix. And this tells us something. If you've ever succumbed to temptation, see I was mentioning that temptation is about the virtue that God wants you to achieve. But what demons are doing in temptation, but also in diabolic obsession and when they're attacking us and our psychological faculties, what they're trying to do is build up a psychological compatibility with themselves. They want your patterns of thinking to be the same as theirs. And this means that they're they're going to want they want you. So if you if they're tempting you, that means they have to have those same set of thoughts. If you're angry, that's because they want you to be angry because they're angry. And so what happens is over the course of time you actually discover that most people have some type of psychological compatibility with the demons that are afflicting them. In fact in possession the liberation process is in six stages. You can tell exactly where someone is in that stage of liberation by how much psychological separation they've obtained with the possessor. If they've got complete psychological separation, doesn't matter what he throws at them, they don't buy it. Then they're pretty close to liberation. But in the very beginning stages, they're just yanked all over the place psychologically and emotionally because they can put thoughts in our head. They can put perspectives in our head. They can jade your perspect perspective of other people. They can then move your emotions. You have these really strong emotions. They can actually move emotions without you even thinking about anything which is another sign that it's diabolic because human beings their emotional life emotions are moved by what's in the imagination. Bet you can you can tell people if you don't like the emotion you're having change what your thought is. Look at it from a different point of view and your emotion will change. Doesn't mean it's easy but that's what that's something to keep in mind and that's part of the battle. The next is possession. And possession, as I said, is very rare. A lot of people come to us and say, "Father, I think I'm possessed." And most of the time, that's not the case. And part of the or I'll get people say, "Father Riper has to be my exorcist." I automatically know I'm not the guy. And the reason I know that is because if that were true, the demon would be doing every possible thing he could do to keep that person away from me. Because if he gets to me and Christ has chosen me to be the instrument of liberation because I liberate no one. Christ liberates everybody. So one times people ask how many people you liberated. I said none. I've been around where Christ liberated a lot of people. But this is something to keep in mind that we're useless instruments. And the way you know that is demons will tell you I don't have to do what you tell me. And that's actually true. But I say that's true, but you have to do what he says. And he's given me the power. So one of the things I'll do is I'll beat out of him. You heard the divine decree, didn't you? You heard God tell you you had to obey me, didn't you? Tell me the word. Tell me what he told you. And every single one of them will will say, "I heard the word obey." So he's not obeying me. He's obeying God. But the possession, the point being is there's that psychological separation that has to be obtained. How do we get that psychological separation? By combating it. but by also the primary way that we do it is by leading an authentic Catholic life. Staying out of sin, avoiding temptations, avoiding person, places, and things. It could call cause us to fall. Receiving the sacraments on a regular basis, prayer on a regular basis. Part of the reason prayer is so effective is because it uses the imagination. So, if you're flooding your imagination with sacred things and the demons are there afflicting it, they're going to bug out because they don't want to deal with that stuff being pushed in their head all the time while they're trying to tempt you. So, they're going to get away from you. The other thing that we've found is I mentioned this in relationship to families and this is true even in possession cases that what we have found a pattern that we started noticing. So, we started this protocol. We put these people on a protocol so that they could begin a prayer regimen and start gaining some elementary discipline in their spiritual lives. And what we started noticing is that people who did this 30-day prayer prescription 30 or so 30 days 80% of the time it cleared out everything that was less than possession within those 30 days. We're like what are we seeing? And it was something which I had noticed too because there were certain things I would tell people to do and I noticed it was having the same effect. And as we started to observe it what we this is what we saw. The reason people the demons attack people and even good families families that are where they're going to mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation. They're getting to confession on a regular basis. They might even be saying the rosary together and yet they're and they're actually following the church's requirements about fasting and all that. And they're still under attack. And we're like, why is that? And this is what we discovered. It's because there's nowhere in their spiritual lives where they're practicing self-denial every single day. Elementary spiritual discipline. What is discipline? It's a virtue in the will by which I'm able to maintain control and regimented direction over my lower faculties. They don't have it. Yeah, you might be saying the rosary, but it's hap it's happen stance or it's here or there. There's no place where they're consistently practicing self-denial. So, putting them on these 30 days where they had to get up at a certain time and do certain things at a certain time and do this requires a self-denial every single day. And that's what was driving the demons out. We also found that that is what makes people immune from attack. The more disciplined you are, the less demons are going to want to attack you. This is total logistics. its warfare strategy. If you have the option of going against a a war machine that is soft, allows people to have time off on the weekends, they don't even do they their standards, requiring um what's required of their soldiers is being lowered all the time, and every time you turn around, they're changing this, they're changing that. They use the they use their military as if it's a form of um you know, social experiment. Oh, sorry, that's a different conference. Okay. or you're going to go up against people that are hardened. They're practicing every single day. They're they're working out. They're doing the hard hikes. They're doing all the training necessary. They're doing all those things in order to do that. They actually stimulate hand-to-hand combat. You're going to go with the soft target. And that's exactly the way demons are. They're not going to come up against somebody who is hardened and fast in their spiritual life. And that means there has to be some place in our spiritual life. It just has to be something small. small. It doesn't have to be huge. Whether it's just getting up every day at 6:00 or whether it's just, you know, practicing denial in the relationship to food at least, you know, every day in some fashion, but just doing something like that will begin that interior discipline. And then the demons are not going to want to be part of that equation. Most people who come to us who are possessed are extra and even obsessed are extraordinarily undisiplined. This is why we're finding so many people under attack. So possession possession are of different kinds. There's partial possession and full possession. Partial possession is is that the demon possesses a part and he's only manifesting that he's only control of the person part of the time. So there's periods of lucidity. You even saw this in the in the case of Analise Michelle upon which the movie The Exorcism of Meily Rose was based on. She was an extraordinarily holy woman and she was actually liberated once and she was cursed by somebody in her town and that's how she became possessed the first time. But then three months after the liberation our lady appeared to her and said will you allow the possession again so that many will come to knowledge of the spiritual realities and she said yes. Boom she became possessed. during her periods of lucidity, this is in Germany in the 70s, she would go over into the chapel uh that was close to where she lived and um during her periods of lucidity and she would pray for hours for the clergy. She actually offered up her possession for the clergy in Germany. The point being is is that there was that interior discipline and that that she actually had. But that's not common. You don't see that with most people. that that's why her possession was partial. Full possession is when the person enters into a state of subjugation, which is the next one, which I'll talk about here in just a minute. But that level of spiritual warfare is one in which the person has given themselves entirely over to the demon and they like the possession. They want to be possessed because the demon's giving them something that they're attached to. Now, he has spent time doing getting the person to that point where there's he's going to give them the person's going to give that him full control, but it's a slow process. But when people give themselves entirely over to him, then that means that the demon is in the driver's seat all the time. He's always manifested, but usually subtly. He mimics the person's personality, and so it's extraordinarily difficult to figure it out. The only way you can tell someone like that is actually possessed is by what they call the secondary signs of possession. The primary signs are things like speaking languages they don't know, um doing things that are supernatural, like having supernatural strength, etc. Those are the types of things that you're not going to see with these people because the demon's in control. He doesn't need to show himself. He's already in control. What you'll see are the secondary signs like malice, duplicity, constantly lying, right? Even when it would go better, they still lie to you. Starting to sound familiar? You start going down the list and it's everything they do maximizes damage within their capacity to do it. This is what you tend to see with people like that. But that kind of possession is extraordinarily rare. And people say, "Have you seen one?" Well, I think I know people who are, but that's speculation on my part. Those types of people will never come to an exorcist because they don't want liberation. It's when people are in their periods of lucidity that they actually think I need help and then that's when they come to us. And then there's al so it's it depends on whether the person is partially or uh fully possessed. You can become possessed in three different ways. One is through mortal sin as I mentioned which is about half our case load. The other half roughly half there's a very small percentage of this third kind but the second kind is when some grave thing has happened to the individual. And so about 50 sometimes a little higher but 50% of the people that come to us are women who have been raped, molested psychologically or physically gravely abused. And that's how the demon got his foot in the door. And people say, "Well, that's not fair." And how does that even happen? They'll say, "Well, it's pretty simple. Anytime that God gave us dominion over the created reality, and if we use that in a disordered way, we not only is our sin and our action under the domain of Satan, but we take the thing which we have dominion over with us in that process. And so when people act against other people in gravely disordered ways, that's how they end up they can become possessed under certain circumstances. The third kind is one in which they've never done any mortal sin. They haven't done any grave sin and there's nothing that's been gravely done to it. This is extraordinarily rare. I've only read about these cases. I've never seen them. The one case I have in mind is there was a case in 1932 in Iowa where a woman nun had become possessed. And so the exorcist went to uh get to the demon to the point where he was trying to figure out, you know, how did you get in? He got the demon to the point where he could finally get the answer out. How did you get in? What sin did she commit? And the demon said, she didn't commit any sin. then what are you doing here? He said God allowed the possession because there's a sin in the region for which he wants make he wants reparation made. So the priest went back in that day exposition was you had to have special permission out there were two times of the year it was permitted outside that you had to have special permission to do it. So he went to the bishop they set up uh reparation in the entire dascese. Two days later the demon was liberated. The sin was divorce. This is something that is very interesting. But she this is those are extremely rare that something like that would actually ever occur. I have like I said I haven't seen authentic cases of it. The second possession obviously of Anelise Michelle would be a case of that possession as I mentioned there's six stages of liberation. The first stage is the OP. This is it's the discovery phase. you figure, well, there's something here. This, you know, that you might think there's actually something here. So, one time this one uh husband went in, his wife was doing yoga in the room, and he said to her, you know, I'm not so sure I like you doing that. And all of a sudden, this is at night, the lights dimmed, it's Terminator eyes start glowing, and out of her mouth comes, "That's for you." And then, boom, the lights came on. Okay, we discovered something. Right. And so then he brings us to us and then sure enough this woman is one of the she she was she's the only case I ever had where the demons said we are legion and I think they were telling us the truth. So there's that discovery phase. Then there's the opiscation phase. This is the phase where they try and convince the person who's possessed or the priest who's working with them about there's no way this could be possession. She just needs more meds. She just needs to go see another psychologist. Maybe she saw this doctor etc. or they'll even put in the priest's minds that she's just crazy. So, one woman I prayed over who had a demon of fear, the first one of the first times I prayed over her is the uh at a certain point she just goes down on the floor and at the exact same time each one of these words floated through my mind came out of her mouth. You just think I'm nuts. And I'm realizing there's your pradernatural sign because the demon put that thought in my head and the only way he could know that is because he put it there and it's coming that exact phrase is coming out of her mouth. So this is one of the indicators that okay but they that they try and offiscate. The third is the battle phase. That's the bulk of the the battle. This is when you actually in the in the during this battle this is when the attacks start to ramp up a little bit with the the exorcist. People ask, you know, is it is it really difficult? The answer is it can be at times, but in point in fact, if you're doing your part, because I'm part of a community that prays three to four hours a day. If you're maintaining your prayer life, you're relatively safe. It doesn't mean you don't get beat around, albeit you've stepped into a boxing room, but it's not that bad. But this is the battle phase, and the battle is over the authority, the demon submitting to the authority that the exorcist actually has. And so over the course of that phase, the demon will start to become more and more compliant. See, I always used to tell people, as a joke, of course, I'd rather deal with demons than parishioners. Because parishioners can start causing you trouble and you can't beat them up and get them under control. Whereas demons, you can beat them up and get them under control. All right? And actually, most parishioners are good. It's there's always that one or two that drives you nuts, right? But anyway, the point being is is that they start to become more un So when by the time you get to end of stage three, he's starting to lose control over the interior dynamics of the possession. And so he shifts it to externally, which is the fourth phase is the external phase. And this is when you'll see things moving around or things happening outside the individual. It's not that common. Most people skip over that phase. So when you see that stuff in Hollywood, that stuff does happen, but it doesn't happen that often. And it usually it's mild. People say, "Have you seen the stuff in Hollywood?" Yeah, I've seen that stuff. But it doesn't happen that often. In fact, again, we keep statistics. It's only in 7% of the cases that you see that kind of stuff moving around. So Hollywood has to, of course, doing it for sensationalism. And quite frankly, that's not the interesting stuff. You know, people say, "Oh, you lead an interesting life." Well, first of all, that's an ancient Chinese curse. But second of all, the interesting part isn't the demons. I tell people, I feel like the guy that's been stuck in a rock, Corey, with a sledgehammer, and his whole job is just to keep whacking the rocks, right? And he that it's just one rock after another. And it's every rock after a while starts looking the same, right? And this is the way being an exorcist is that in point in fact demons are extraordinarily consistent and their consistency is based on three things. The fact that God regulates them. They cannot do anything that he does not permit. Literally down to who can possess, how many possessors there can be, the degree of the possession, what part of the body they possess, when they can manifest, the nature of the manifestation, the degree of the manifestation. Literally every single facet of their interaction with you is entirely regulated by God. This tells us that they should not be feared. Even Christ said, "You shouldn't fear them." We have to have perfect confidence in him and our lady. But the other thing is their nature. Their nature didn't change when they fell. They're still inclined towards specific things. And so they're very consistent on that. And then the third is their will is now fixed in their sin. And so that's what they hyperfocus on. And so between those three things, demons keep doing the same thing over and over and over again. I've had Lucifer in three cases, be elabub in three cases, you know, and they do the same stuff over and over and over again. And after a while, it just gets old, right? I'm just here breaking the rocks. The interesting thing is what God compels them to reveal about the saints or our lady. Give you a couple of examples. Beelub once had to reveal that the reason our lady is different from every single other creature is because she sacrificed her entire life and never once counted the personal cost. That means she's not like any angel because angels only got one choice to sacrifice. She did it over and over and over again. He said it was the perpetuity that got me. he said. And then she never counted the personal cost. There's not one of us in this room that has not counted the personal cost. That's why she's different. That's interesting. That's beautiful. Or the fact that St. Jon of Arc is the nemesis of Satan under the title of treason through ambition. Think of that. Treason through ambition. And the reason she became the nemesis of Satan under that specific aspect is because the bishop who put her to death was doing it so that he could gain a higher bishop prick. That was his ambition. And he was a Frenchman committing treason by siding with the English. How God fashioned your life determines how what you know whether you're going to become a nemesis of some demon or not. And so in possession the third is the you go through this battle. The third the fourth is the external phase. The fifth is what we call the ascendancy phase. This is when the person has gained a lot of degree of psychological um uh they've broken the psychological compatibility with the demon. And the demon at this point becomes completely compliant. You don't even have to give him a a uh a precursor to the command. So usually I but I tell just keep doing it just for your own humility. But whenever you command them, so it's like in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to tell me. By the power of the immaculate conception, I command you to tell me. So you you're precursoring it with something that actually has force in the demon's mind. Your word has nothing in their mind, but these things have force. But then at a certain point once the demon gets he's now to the point where he just wants out. It's so brutal for him. Hell is a better option than sitting in a session. It literally gets that brutal for them. And so they will, and this is why, you know, people say, you know, because in Hollywood they always make it like the exorcist is scared. Oh no, the demon is the one that's scared because he knows that's the trajectory of this thing. And he's just going to get this brutal beating and there's nothing he can do about it. And so he's just going to it's just this is part of the their ch this is part of their uh justice that God meets out on them. Sometimes demons think, "Oh, this is great to possess." But then when it turns and that the the possess the possessed starts actually beating up the possessor, it gets a little ugly because the demon doesn't like it. But they become completely compliant to the point where you can just tell them here do this, do that. Now I still do the precursors just for my own humility, but also to continue that force and they get to the point where they are absolutely compliant. Stage five actually has four parts to it. The first is that initial stage where they they become compliant. The second stage is called the se the sril stage. This is when saints will appear. Not to me, I don't see them. They appeared to the person who's possessed and to the demon. So in one of the last cases I had when St. Jonah arc was part of it, she actually appeared to the woman. John Paul 2 actually appeared to the woman. St. Joseph appeared to the woman during this phase during this timeline. Our lady will often appear as well. Then this third the third part is uh the bargaining phase. Okay, they've lost the battle. So they approach God and ask for something hoping that he'll give him permission which he almost always says no. And then the last is the penitential phase. Okay, I've lost. I'm defeated. I'm just going to put in my time so that I can get out. And so they're completely compliant. They're trying to get out on good behavior. The last stage is actual liberation. Again, possession is rare. It does happen, but it's not that common. The last is subjugation. This subjugation is when the person enters into a pact with the devil. And basically, it's a form of contract in which the person gives the the demon something, their soul or something like that. And then in lie of that the demon will actually provide something for the person who's entering into the pact. There technically speaking there is never a valid contract or a valid pact with the demon. Why? Because they cannot anytime you enter into a contract you have to have certitude that the that the both parties in the contract can fulfill their obligations of the contract. If one of them of the parties cannot fulfill that obligation, the contract's null and void, at least on a spiritual level. And the demons can't guarantee that because again, God controls everything. So they can't guarantee that he's going to give this to you. Sometimes he does though. You've probably seen this quote of mine, but it's actually true. John Lennon sold his soul to the devil, and the devil said 20 years. He was shot 20 years to the weak. But the the selling of the soul was for fame. You got it. But then sometimes they'll the people will sell their soul to the devil and they get nothing out of it but possession. So I had one guy that was possessed and he sold his soul to to the devil. He ended up becoming possessed by the noonday devil in Psalm 91. And yeah, it's a real guy. It's interesting. The noonday devil is the demon. This is what the fathers of the church say. So, we're talking between 150 and about 600. They say that he's the demon of the midlife crisis. Interesting. Anyway, he's also the demon of a chadia or spiritual sloth. So, anyway, this guy becomes possessed by this. At a certain point, I ask him, "Well, how did you think you become possessed?" "Well, I made a pact with the devil." "Well, what was the pact for?" "Fame and money. Did you get those?" "No." "Well, that ought to learn you." All you got was possession in the process because again they can't determine demons cannot validly enter into a contract. The other part of it is historically in the moral sphere they always said that you can only enter into a contract with someone who's alive that actually has a body and therefore can fulfill the terms of the contract. So you can't enter into contracts with someone who's dead although they can seem to vote these days. But the point is is that they you can't enter in contract with a dead man. And also that means the demons because they don't have a body. They can't fulfill the terms of the contract. So you can't enter a pack. So people say, "Well, how do you get out from underneath if you've gone into a pack with the devil?" You just have to literally make a renunciation. Just renounce it. I renounce the pact I made with Satan for these things and that's it. However, so the pact is now broken because it only has any force because the person voluntarily maintains themselves underneath the demon during the during the process. Once they reject it, then it no longer has any legal binding force. But the effects can persist because once you've let the demon in your life, he can then start meddling and causing other problems, possess you, etc. Okay. So, subjugation, um, we're seeing that on the rise these days. There's people that are in Hollywood, in the music industry who are openly talking about themselves doing this. This is something which the possession they talk about possession of countries. So, some people said, do you think that Nazi Germany was possessed? No, I think it's collect collective obsession, not possession because possession is a specific nature. But they can also demons can influence societies, regions. There's certain areas in this country that just have different kinds of demons. If you go to Fresno, California, it's a demon of illness that's there. It's not shocking in Hollywood. It's a demon of unreality. Uh I haven't been around New York enough. I've been here numerous times. I haven't been around enough to find out which one's here. In the south, it's demons associated with Freemasonry, which is quite a few of them actually. So, these are the different levels of spiritual warfare. Are they increasing? The answer is not possession, but ordinary temptation and all the other ones seem to be on the rise, especially the diabolic obsession and oppression. Oppression is also on the rise because of the increase in the occult activity. Witches that are casting curses and doing things like that are causing a lot of damage. People ask me, well, you know, what do you think about the fact that these witches got on there and they were cursing Pence or they were cursing this person or cursing that person? And I always tell them, well, first of all, Satanists and witches that are public are always at the very best middle tier people. Usually they're lowlevel people that are involved in the occult. The high level of people in the occult, these are people where witchcraft has been in their families for three to 400 years. Their knowledge about how this stuff worked is almost on the same level as mine. They know exactly how this stuff works. They know exactly what rituals will be get specific effects. And they do it and you will never know who they are. They could be the person sitting next to you in the pew. Don't look. All right. They can be the police officer, the judge. They can be the guy that's your baker. They can be the totally normal people that seem really nice and kind to you. Right? Those people that are involved in the occult at the higher level, it's occult. It's hidden. And it's hidden because once it's discovered, it guts the effectiveness of what they're doing. And so, they always keep it quiet. The same thing with Satanists. These guys that get out there and say, "Oh, it's a Satanist at this level." I never buy it. And the reason it never bite is because Satanism is like the mafia. Blood in and blood out. You go in there, you do that stuff, you're not getting out alive as a general rule. That the guys that are at the very top of the heap. And this that the reason that the Satanists keep their stuff a cult is because they're doing things that are literally capital crimes and they're so evil and so wicked. They know that people won't tolerate it once it's discovered. So they have to keep it completely a cult. You're just not going to find out about it. But things are getting worse. So what does our lady think of our times? There is a correspondence between I think and what our lady thinks and actually the diabolic influence in our lady of good success when she appeared at Keto Ecuador she said the following things. Thus I make it known to you that from the end of the 19th century and from shortly after the middle of the 20th century in what is today the colony and will then be the republic of Ecuador, the passions will erupt. So there's going to be a collapse morally and there will be a total corruption of customs for Satan will reign almost completely by means of Masonic sex. They will focus principally on children in order to sustain the general corruption. Our Lady predicted in the latter half of the last century, Satan would have enormous power. He would rule almost completely in Ecuador. Almost completely. Almost. But it's not just Ecuador. Alas, she says, "How deeply I grieve to manifest to you the enormous sacrileges, both public as well as secret, that will occur from profanation of the Holy Eucharist." Often during this epic, our Lady says, "The enemies of Jesus Christ, instigated by the devil, will steal consecrated hosts from the churches so that they might profane the sacred species. My most holy son will see himself cast upon the ground and trampled upon by filthy feet. Since this poor country, so she's still talking about Ecuador, the sacrament of extreme uncction will be little valued. We see this. I can't tell you how many times you tell people, "Your father's dying." Yeah. What do you want me to come anointing? No, he's good. He's a good guy. He's going to go to heaven. You know, people just don't even make sure that their parents get the sacraments. Many people will die without receiving it. Our lady says, either because of the negligence of their families or misconceived affection for their sick ones. She named it. Others incited by the cursed devil will rebel against the spirit of the Catholic Church and will deprive countless souls of innumerable graces and consolations and the strength that they need to make the great leap from time to eternity. But some persons will die without receiving it due to just and secret chastisements of God. So our lady predicted Satan is going to ascend. There's going to be an ascendancy. We also know this by virtue of the prophecy that um that the actual vision that Leo the 13th saw. He saw Satan gaining an ascendancy for a hundred years. He approached he saw the interaction. Satan approached God and said, "Give me a hundred years." And God gave it to him. Why a hundred years? It's because there's a thing called immemorial custom or immemorial memory. Human memory is roughly 70 to 80 years. And if you get outside that generation that can remember how the faith is lived, how the faith used to be done, what the actual devotions were, how they used to pray and things like that, if you can get a hundred years out and that's not being done, then it will have been forgotten and therefore extinguished. That's why you wanted the hundred years. So then she says, "Our Lady, as for the sacrament of matrimony, which symbolizes the union of Christ with his church, it will be attacked and deeply profained. Freemasonry, which will then be in power, will enact iniquitous laws with the aim of doing away with this sacrament, making it easy for everyone to live in sin and encouraging the procreation of illegitimate children born without the blessing of the church. According to the CDC, the number of live births to unmarried women in this country is 1.6 million. The percentage of births to unmarried women is now 40%. The number of people who live together before they're married, I've seen different statistics, but I'll give you the one that's on the lower end. 76% of people living say they live together before they're married and think it's okay. 76%. Statistically, they say now 79%. By the way, Catholics aren't any better. The statistical differentiation is 1 to 2% from the general populace. We're not any better. Our Lady then goes on to say, "The sacrament of holy orders will be ridiculed, oppressed, and despised. For in this sacrament, the church of God and even God himself is scorned and despised since he is rep since he is represented in his priests. The devil will try to persecute the ministers of the Lord in every possible way. He will label with cruel and subtle astuteness to deviate them from the spirit of their vocation and will corrupt many of them. These depraved priests will scandalize the Christian people. We've seen that in our own lifetimes. The whole pedophilia scandal is just nothing but pure scandal and will make the hatred of bad Catholics and the enemies of the Catholic Church and the aposto fall upon these priests. This apparent triumph of Satan, she says, will bring enormous suffering to good pastors of church. This is true. When I go all around the country and talk to good priests, they say this whole thing is such a burden of living under this constant suspicion. The many good priests and the supreme pastor and victory of Christ on earth who in a prisoner in the Vatican will shed secret and bitter tears in the presence of his God and Lord beseeching light, sanctity, and perfection for all the clergy of the world. Further, in these unhappy times, there will be unbrided luxury. Now, luxury here, she's actually referring to lust. It's from the Latin word luxuria, which means lust, which will ins snare the rest into sin and conquer innumerable frivolous souls who will be lost. Our Lady said that most more souls go to heaven because of the sins of the flesh than any other reason. Sister Luchia, [clears throat] the last living Fatima Seir, said this refers primarily to sins against chastity. Innocence, our lady said, so this is still in in Kudo Ecuador. Innocence will almost no longer be found in children, nor modesty in women. Our Lady said at Fatima that certain fashions are being introduced that offend our Lord very much. This is obviously true. Think about what Pas the 11th said. He said, "A dress cannot be considered decent, which is cut too deep, too cut deeper than two fingers breath from the pit of the throat, which does not cover the arms, at least to the elbows, and scarcely reaches a bit beyond the knees. Furthermore, dresses of transparent materials are improper." Tells you how much our understanding of that has shifted. Our ladies then goes on and said during that epoch the church will find herself under attack by terrible hordes of the masonic sect and this poor Ecuadorian land will be agonized because of corruption of customs, unbridled lust, impious the impious press and secular education. Like a filthy ocean, it will be inundate the streets, squares and public places with astonishing liberty. We see that even in our own country. There will be almost no virgin souls in the world. Our Lady said at Loellet, the priests, the ministers of my son by their wicked lives, by their irreverence and their impiety and the celebration of the holy mysteries that is like mass etc. by their love of money and their love of honors and pleasures and the priests have become cesspools of impurity. This is in 1832 that we already have a collapse of chastity among the clergy. Everybody's got this idea that the pedophilia problem in the church have it in the 70s and 80s. That's when the effect occurred. In 1960, there was a document put out by the congregation for religious to all the heads of religious orders around the country. The name of the document, you can read it online. It's called Institutio Religious forum. In that document, this is in 1960, they they there was three essential things in that document. Stop ordaining the homosexuals, stop ordaining the pedophiles, and stop ordaining priests who are not chased. This is in 1960, which means that the moral collapse in the church didn't happen after Vatican 2. It happened before. It's just that there was a vestigual cultural gas that was still running the things on the externals. Woe to the priests and those dedicated to God who by their unfaithfulness, this is our lady again, and their wicked lives in crucifying my son. St. John Yud said that the worst chastisement that God can meet out on a people is giving them bad clergy. At Akita, Japan in 1979 and 80. Our Lady said, "The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the church in such a way we will see cardinals opposing cardinals and bishops against bishops." Were there. But notice that she doesn't tie it to anything necessarily coming out of the Vatican. She's tying it to the work of the devil. It's because we in the church are not engaging in the spiritual battle to the degree and in the manner that we need to that we're all suffering this. The priests will venerate me will be scorned and opposed by their confer. Churches and altars will be sacked. The church will be full of those who accept compromise. And the demon will press many priests and consecrated souls to leave the service of the Lord. I cannot tell you how many good priests I've seen leave the priesthood. They just can't take it anymore. The thought of the loss of so many souls is the cause of my sadness. Our Lady says, "If sin increase in number and gravity, there will be no longer pardon for them." At Loellet, our lady said, "The vicor of my son will suffer a great deal because for a while the church will yield to a large persecution, a time of darkness, and the church will witness a frightful crisis. Do we think we can be so sinful and yet God doesn't punish it? You know, people tell me, "Oh, you know, you hear this, you even hear bishops saying this. Oh, God doesn't punish us through natural disasters like he did in the past." Really? New Orleans has the highest rate of voodoo in this country, and they got wiped out by Katrina. If you go to Haiti, the Dominican Republic sits on the exact same island. And the Dominican Republic is virtually never disturbed. But Haiti has been sacked over and over again by uh by earthquakes. And why? Because Haiti, the president, actually consecrated the country to the demons and the Dominican Republic to the Sacred Heart of our Lord. There's the difference. where they found the tsunami hit in Thailand was the epicenter of the international pedophilia rings. When the Red Cross went in, they they were stunned because the only thing they found were men and boys. Where are the women? They said, "Don't give me that. Do we believe do we think that we can be this sinful?" I'll give you an example. This is this is to give you an idea that we do know that the demons are getting more powerful, but there is an upside. So, it's not all lost. St. Francis shortly before he died made the following prediction. I'm not going to read you the whole thing. You can find it actually online. He said, "Act bravery, my brethren. Take courage and trust in the Lord. A time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions. Perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound. The charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase. And the devils will have unusual power. We're there. Most exorcists in the last two years have complained that they've liberated fully no one. the as I mentioned there was this progression how it's taking longer and longer and they say well the average time is now four years but we've entered into a stage where now we're hardly liberating anyone and the grind is just grinding and grinding and grinding. So they do have unusual power because why we gave it to him. You see what most people don't realize is that demons do not increase in power in their nature. Their will has a certain amount of force and power by its nature. What happens is every time we commit sin and open the door, they get in and then by our sin, we become weaker and more subjugated to them and that's why they seem more powerful. So how do you stop it? You just tell them stop sinning. The problem of thinking that we are dealing with just natural problems and the state of the world and the church and stuff like that. But if you actually look at it, I don't know about you, but you know, when I look at when I have to look in the face of of demons manifesting, I see hell. It's the world is starting to look like that. The more sinful we become, the more our world becomes like hell. The more holy we become, the more it becomes like heaven. And this is what we people just don't seem to grasp. But I do want to end this conference positively. As I mentioned, the demons are on a short rope. They can only do what God permits. And their time is never indefinite. In fact, the demons are showing all the signs of being frantic that their time is coming to a short to an end. I've had more than one demon tell me their time is short. They know it's short and they'll literally cry because they like all this power they're getting. So, they're g their they know their time is short. It's going to end. But that also means that God is going to put an end to it. And so we should have perfect confidence in him. But also because he has complete control, we should have absolute and perfect confidence in God that anytime any type of diabolic influence occurs in our lives that it is God who's regulating it and that if we just approach it properly, it can be to our sanctification, our purification, our growth and virtue. We also know that even in the church when it just seems to be in a meltdown mode that it doesn't matter how bad things get, Christ said the gates of hell will not prevail. It'll get bad for a while, but it will not prevail. And then lastly, if the if the demons have gained ascendancy and if things are as evil as they are, we know from scripture that where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more. This means to those who are faithful to grace, that fidelity to grace that when God gives you grace to go to church, he gives you grace to go pray, if you're completely faithful to that, what that means is because so many people aren't, God is still generous and he wants to give those things out. And so that means that this is an unprecedented time to grow holy. It is there. This is the time be because things are so evil. If we remain faithful to the God grace gives us, we will reach a height of perfection that only the saints said they wish they had the opportunity. They saw what was coming. They saw what we're going through and they said they wish they could have lived in they could live in those times because the degree of sanctity and the graces that are available are available in ways that are simply not available to them in their time. So this is means that if you're faithful to grace despite how difficult it is to deal with the evil in the church, despite the fact that other people committing all this evil and now we're dealing with their demons and we're dealing with other stuff and despite the fact that there's so much uh oppression and things are just so difficult and there's all these levels of prayer and levels of evil and they seem to be rising. The fact of the matter is is that if you're faithful and you're completely faithful to grace, your odds of becoming a saint are there. They're real. And God wants you to do that. So don't fail in that regard. Don't be unfaithful to grace. And in that, that means you're going to defeat the demons. You're going to get the crown of glory. Because when you get to heaven, if you've defeated the demons in your own life, because every family has them, right? And every person is afflicted by them. But if you defeat them in heaven, when people see you, they're going to say, "You're the one that beat up soand so and you fight this and it's going to be to your glory." This is the time in which this is more possible than any other time. It's a time in which your place in heaven, you can gain a higher place in heaven than in many respects the paces times in the past could not have been achieved. So do not fail in this opportunity that God has given to you. If you'll kneel, I'll give you a blessing. Superman. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Join the faithful and download the Census Fidelium app today.
