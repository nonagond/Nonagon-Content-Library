Kind: captions Language: en Have you ever wondered what happens to the soul of someone who ends their own life? Does the church believe there is any hope for those who fall into such despair? And is there a place for prayer even after a tragedy that seems to close every door? Throughout the 20th century, [music] countless families have silently carried the wound of suicide. It is a pain that does not fade easily because it touches [music] the deepest mystery of life and death. Within this painful question, the church has always stood between two fundamental truths. The gravity of the act and the limitless mercy of God. Few figures in the history of the church [music] were given a clearer insight into this mystery than Padre Peio of Petrichina. Padre Peio, the Capuin frier from southern Italy, became known around the world for the stigmata that marked his hands for 50 years, for his tireless hours in the confessional, and for miracles recorded even by skeptical doctors. But behind these visible signs, [music] there was another gift, discreet and terrifying in its implications. Padre Peio could perceive the state of souls, including those who had already left this world. Witnesses claimed that he often saw souls in need of prayer approaching him in search of help. Among [music] the testimonies preserved in historical documentation, there are two particularly striking cases involving people who died by suicide. They are recorded in Bernard Ruffin's biography Padre Peio the true story with the direct testimony of those who lived alongside the saint especially father Joseph Pius who served for many years as one of his closest [music] collaborators. In one case a widow approached Padre Peio in agony. Her husband had ended his own life. She had lived for months with a single question that devoured her peace. What had happened to his soul? When she [music] finally gathered the courage to seek Padre Peio's help, she approached him with tears in her eyes. She asked, almost in a whisper, whether there was any hope that her husband might have been saved. Padre Peio lowered his eyes. His face darkened with sorrow. After a grave silence, he responded quietly. [music] "There is very little hope. The woman felt her heart collapsing under the weight of that answer." But then something changed. Padre Paio suddenly raised his gaze as if he were looking at something invisible to every other eye in the room. His expression [music] shifted. His tone became firm, absolute. And then [music] he said, "No, there is no hope." The mystery of that moment has been discussed by many. Did Padre Peio see the final state of that soul? If so, [music] his response was not a condemnation, but a testimony that the final rejection of God is a possibility, terrible and real. However, the second case shows the opposite outcome. Another widow arrived with similar sorrow. Her husband too had died by suicide. She asked the same question. Is there any hope? This time Padre Peio paused and again seemed to see something [music] invisible. And then he answered with peace in his voice. He was saved. He [music] repented between the bridge and the river. In that single phrase, Padre Peio affirmed a truth that the church holds with profound seriousness. Between the human decision and the moment when life leaves the body, there exists [music] a final instant, a final breath, a final possibility, a space where grace can intervene [music] and the heart can cry out to God even when no one else hears. A space where darkness can be interrupted by a final spark of hope. This is the teaching of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. It does not diminish the gravity of suicide. It does not excuse it. But it recognizes the dramatic weight of suffering and mental disturbance. It expresses this balance [music] with precision. Suicide is seriously contrary to justice, hope, and charity. However, immediately afterward, the catechism adds, "Grave psychological disturbances, [music] anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide." And finally, the most important statement, [music] we should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. God can provide the opportunity for a salutary repentance. The church prays for such persons. These paragraphs reveal the deep Catholic conviction [music] that although suicide opposes God's gift of life, we cannot judge the soul. We see the exterior action. God sees the heart in its last instant. Padre Peio's experiences corroborate this truth. Two men, two suicides, two radically different outcomes. The final judgment [music] belongs to God. This mystery resonates even with what modern science has discovered. In the 19th century, the sociologist Emil Durkheim demonstrated that strong family bonds and meaningful relationships protect a person from suicide. In the 20th century, Victor Frankl, [music] psychiatrist, reached the same conclusion inside the most brutal environment on earth. Those who survived the camps were those who held on to meaning, someone [music] to love, something to accomplish, or the desire to reach heaven. Despair arises when all bonds are broken. In that sense, suicide often reveals not a fully free rejection of life, but a collapse under unbearable psychological weight. Padreo saw that suffering [music] many times. He heard thousands confess their darkest struggles. He suffered physically, spiritually, and emotionally in secret. That is why though he acknowledged the gravity of suicide, he always encouraged prayer for those who died tragically. In addition to these accounts, Bernard Ruffin records another revealing story. It does not involve suicide, but it helps us understand Padre Peio's sensitivity [music] toward the dead. A young priest, Father Dominic, had lost [music] his mother. And although her death had not involved despair or any mortal sin, he longed to know where she was. He asked Padre Pio to exchange mass [music] intentions with him so that Padre Pio would offer mass for his mother. After mass, Padreio approached him with a radiant smile. He embraced him tightly [music] and whispered just two words in Italian. Mama in Paradiso. It was not just a pious guess, but a certainty that sprang from what he had seen at the altar. This moment reveals the core of Padreio's spiritual mission. To console, to absolve, to rescue souls from despair, to offer them a final path toward God. His [music] constant request was that people pray for the departed. He believed that prayer reaches beyond death, that love crosses the boundary of the grave. Padre [music] Peio once declared that purgatory should be emptied by prayer. He spoke frequently about souls who visited him to ask for masses or sacrifices. For him, death was not the end of the relationship between the living and the dead. There is a link that remains. A bond sustained by prayer, guided by hope, illuminated by faith. If we follow this insight, the message becomes clear. Tragedy does not erase the image of God in the soul. There is no abyss into which God cannot descend. There is no darkness where grace cannot reach. Even when the human mind collapses, God remembers the person he created. And even when someone falls from the bridge, grace may reach them before they reach the water. The church [music] does not promise universal salvation. It does not turn suicide into a minor fault. What it teaches is far more profound [music] and far more serious. No one knows what happens in the final heartbeat. A lifetime of sorrow may be met in the final second by the mercy of Christ. Therefore, the church insists on two moral duties. [music] To accompany those who suffer in life with love and to accompany the departed with prayer. To abandon [music] neither the living nor the dead. In the end, Padre Peio's encounters with souls are not stories about punishment or condemnation. They are stories [music] about the struggle for salvation. They are reminders that God [music] does not give up on any soul until the very end. They show that our prayers, our sacrifices, our intercessions can become the bridge across which a soul walks toward eternal life. This is [music] the hope offered to every Christian who has lost someone to suicide. Do not despair. Continue to love them. Continue to pray for them. Trust the judgment of God who sees the heart in its final instant [music] and desires always to save. If God saved a soul in the gap between the bridge and the river, then he can [music] reach anyone. Before we end, remember someone you know may be carrying a silent pain. Someone may [music] be wondering if there is still hope for a soul lost to despair. If this story [music] touched you, share this video with that person. It may be the very message they have [music] been waiting for. And if you want to continue discovering the hidden stories of the saints, the mysteries of grace, and the consoling truth of our faith, subscribe to this channel. Here we keep their lives alive, not as legends of the past, but as lights for today. Let us [music] pray for one another. Let us pray for the living and for the dead. And let us never forget, God never stops calling a soul to himself.
