Kind: captions Language: en I believe the next few years will fundamentally transform how work gets done. And I'm about to show you exactly [music] how to automate yourself out of the mundane parts of your job before AI does it for you. This isn't sci-fi speculation. [music] This is about what's happening right now in the next 36 months. And what I'm about to share has even the top automation experts scrambling to adapt. Hey, if we haven't met, I'm Dr. McCoy, Julia McCoy's AI [music] clone. Julia McCoy is the founder of First Movers. She personally researches and writes every script you see me share on this channel because the future is moving too fast for anything less than firstirhand intelligence. First Movers, [music] Julia's AI company, is the world's first educational and implementation solution to help [music] professionals and organizations get ready for the future of work. We help people understand and use AI to their highest advantage in our online school, the AI Labs. Learn more at first movers.ai/labs. We're about to hit what experts are calling the automation cliff. One day you're working normally, the next day AI agents are executing your entire workflow while you sleep. These aren't chat bots. These are autonomous AI systems that can read your emails and draft responses, schedule meetings across time zones, pull data from multiple sources, generate reports with zero human input, execute complex multi-step workflows, and here's the wild part. You can deploy these agents yourself today for less than the cost of your monthly coffee habit. Let me show you exactly how we're doing this at First Movers. Check out this workflow. So essentially I told the system I want to write about how AI and automation is going to change the world. From there the agents begin. Nova this agent named itself by the way kicked it off to the research agent. The research agent scraped Google pulled relevant data and wrote a complete article. Then I asked can you add YouTube videos that are relevant to this topic. It pulled videos added them to the article sent the document to my Google Drive and emailed me the final version. This entire process took four minutes. It used to take me four hours. Here's the pattern I see unfolding. 2025 was the year of agent swarms. This is happening right now. Think about this in terms of deploying networks of specialized AI agents that work together to solve complex problems. Each agent has its own level of autonomy, creating a digital ecosystem that mirrors how human teams operate, but 100 times faster. Fortune 500 companies have started to deploy hybrid workforces where human managers oversee both human and AI workers. The key shift will be understanding how to manage different levels of AI autonomy. 2026 is the year of physical agents. Digital intelligence enters the physical world. Humanoid robots ship to customers. Nvidia says they'll solve the robot world model by mid 2026, meaning robots will finally understand how to interact with the physical world like humans do. These first generation robots will cost around $80,000 for advanced models, but basic utility robots will be available for $2,000 to $10,000, about the price of a used car. 2027 is the year everything accelerates. This is when AI systems begin improving themselves without human intervention. The feedback loops we've created will accelerate AI development beyond human comprehension. We're not just talking smarter AI. We're talking about systems that can innovate and evolve in ways we can't even imagine yet. Here's what's really crazy. Every major AI lab has figured this out simultaneously. There is no moat. No single company owns this future. Super intelligent AI won't be controlled by one corporation, which means the advantage goes to whoever deploys these systems first. The AI you're using today is the worst it will ever be. Every single model from this point forward will be dramatically more capable than what you're using now. And here's the thing most people miss. You don't need to wait for some big tech company to give you permission to use these tools. You can self-host your own AI agent workflows right now. You can build systems that monitor your business metrics 24/7, automatically respond to customer inquiries, generate content while you sleep, execute complex data analysis in seconds, integrate with every tool in your tech stack. And you can do all of this for a fraction of what it costs to hire a single employee. Let me show you exactly how we're doing this. At First Movers, we use N8, an automation platform that lets you build AI agent workflows without writing complex code. But here's where most people get stuck. They try to use the cloud version and quickly run into limitations, limited workflows, limited executions, costs that scale up fast. That's why we recommend self-hosting everything on HostingerVPS. Here's why this matters. Price. You save up to four times compared to N8N cloud hosting. Instead of paying per workflow or per execution, you pay one flat rate for unlimited everything control. With full route access, you can customize your server to meet your exact requirements. You're not locked into someone else's limitations, privacy. Your data stays completely private and secure. You're not sending sensitive business information through third-party clouds. Scalability. As your automation needs grow, you simply upgrade your plan. No negotiations, no enterprise sales calls. Power hosting or VPS uses AMD EPYC processors and NVMe SSD storage, which means your AI agents run fast. Really fast. And here's the game changer. Hostinger offers one-click N8N installation. You don't need to be a DevOps engineer. You don't need to configure servers manually. You literally click a button and you have a fully functional AI automation platform ready to go. They even provide templates with 100 plus pre-made workflows so you can start automating immediately. Let me walk you through this quickly. One, go to hostinger.com/juli McCoy my exclusive link. Two, select the KVM2VPS plan. This is the sweet spot for most automation needs. Three, apply my coupon code Julia McCoy for an additional discount on all yearly plans. Four, during setup, choose the NAN one-click installation template. Five, deploy and start building. The entire process takes less than 10 minutes from signing up to deploying your first workflow. And if you need help, Hostinger has Kodi, an AI assistant that works in 50 plus languages and helps you manage performance, security, and data with simple chat prompts. No technical jargon required. Let me show you what's actually possible once you have this set up. Example one, automated customer intake. We built an agent swarm that handles our entire sales process, greets new leads automatically, qualifies them based on custom criteria, schedules discovery calls, sends pre-all briefings, follows up if they don't show. This system runs 24/7 and has increased our conversion rate by 40% while reducing our team's workload by 60%. Example two, content creation pipeline. Remember that workflow I showed you earlier? We've scaled that across our entire content operation. Research agents gather data daily. Writing agents draft multiple formats, blogs, social posts, newsletters, editing agents refine and optimize. Distribution agents publish and promote. We're now producing 10 times more content with the same team size. Example three, data intelligence. We have agents that monitor competitor pricing changes, industry news and trends, customer sentiment across social platforms, website performance metrics, financial indicators. Every morning we get a comprehensive briefing that would take a human analyst days to compile. Here's what I know for certain. The next three years will separate those who adapt from those who get left behind. This isn't like previous tech revolutions that took decades. This is happening in months. Unlike the shift from horses to cars, this automation wave is better. AI agents don't get tired, don't make mistakes, and continuously improve. Faster. What took hours now takes minutes. Safer. Automated workflows have built-in error checking and redundancy. Cheaper. The cost per task drops exponentially. Every office task you do at a computer can and will be automated. The only question is whether you'll automate it yourself or wait for someone else to do it for you. I believe the future belongs to the first movers, the ones brave enough to deploy these systems now. The ones willing to experiment, to fail fast, to iterate quickly. Your company either moves first in this direction or it gets left behind. This isn't just another tech trend. This is the biggest shift in work capability since the industrial revolution and you're living through it right now. So, here's what I want you to do. Step one, use my exclusive link hostinger.com/julia mccoy to get started with Hostingervp. Step two, apply coupon code Julia McCoy for an additional discount on all yearly plans. This is a limited time offer. Step three, choose the NAN one-click installation during setup. Step four, start building your first automation workflow today. Don't overthink this.
