Kind: captions Language: en Hello everybody. It's a crazy Friday. Everything is all over the shop. We're going to break it all down. It's Friday fire and we're going to talk a lot about Bitcoin and where we are because we've had other stuff going on this weekend. Crypto markets, some new records, some new winners, some new losers, and so much more. So, thank you all for coming. Thank you to the best mods in the world in the chat too and everybody else being there. By the way, we have a little survey going as well if you are live. It's about what is your optimal length of video that you like 10 20 30 40 minutes. So let me know because if you want shorter I can do a lot less where I can make that happen. But the story like today we read about 300 articles. We pick the best and we weave together a great tapestry that you may have missed of all the good stuff during the day. So, let's go as they say and make sure I haven't broken anything. Okay. Yeah, this one's called 40 below because it's winter time and it's cold in different places and never financial advice. And a big thank you to Rick and Patreon. You're the Patreon equivalent of an Iron Man. I've done about 70 half iron mans. Never did a full iron man. Never had the time. But I appreciate that and I can relate to it. Let's get into sentimental signals. First of all, crypto is still at seven. Extreme fear. We did fall as low as five about 10 days ago. Now it's back up to seven. It hit nine two or three days ago. Back down to seven. People are terrified. People are worried. People are anxious. People are bored. The sentiment is very low. But remember everybody, and I say this a thousand times, billions are made in the bear. Okay? This is not the time to lose interest. It's very difficult to make money in a bull market. Very easy in a bear if you're patient. So please everybody don't don't lose faith. This is the most important time. We we went to this before, okay? Not the time to lose faith. Stocks, fear and greed is at 40, so not too hot there either, but there's a lot of weird macro stuff going on. We'll break that down, too. Let's talk about Bitcoin and crypto. Yeah, look at the results so far. February is down 14%. It's been a nasty fab. And that's why I understand why people are like, "Oh my god, Bitcoin sucks." Yeah, especially after Jen down 10% and everything else. But here we are, five months of hell. It's ugly and it happened fast. Got a lot of people with their pants down. Let's look at some charts. Let's look at uh this is our mean reversion from IDs. We are at the lowest level on the mean reversion. That little dip at the bottom, little blue thing is the lowest level since November 2022. By the way, guess what happened in November 2022? That was the low of the Bitcoin bare market. Is there a pattern here that we can look at? Maybe. Maybe. But we'll see. Either way, a lot of people are chatting about how this could be a It was definitely a quicker dip, could it be a shallower dip? Could it be a quick recovery? It all depends on the money coming in. Let's look at some other charts that are important to take into account as well. Bitcoin's fair. Bitcoin, this is from Andre, by the way. Bit, not Bitcoin's not fair. Bitcoin's current price is 40% below the model fair value implied by the global ETP flows. So something funk is going on because given ETP ETFs the money coming in etc. it it's really way way way off where it should be considering how much money has come into the space through these tools. Now, what Andre Drago says is once the risk appetite returns, Bitcoin could run it back turbo. So, I keep saying money, money, money, no money, no fun. If the money starts coming back into ETFs, we could run it back real fast. And remember, it just takes, you know, the price drives a narrow. When the price is down, negative and stable, people get bored and they move on to different shiny new objects. Once the price if it does rebound a lot of people will come back real fast. Let's look at the another chart here. This is the gold Bitcoin divergence from Deran BTC is according to him Bitcoin is trading at 51% below its gold relative moving average and this divergence is 64% off where it typically should be and that's in the first percentile of events. So basically only 1% of the time it's ever this low. And this is basically the other way to interpret this. This is the most extreme extreme Bitcoin underperformance versus gold in the history of Bitcoin. We're going back 16 years. Wild. Now there's some other weird stuff happening with Bitcoin. We had that massive dip a couple weeks ago in the hash rate. The bottom chart here is from the tabby model and the top one is the Bitcoin price. Now we always go back to the age old thing is does price follow the hash or hash follow the price. It's very difficult to say. There's different theories on both depending on the weather depending on the markets. The more hash the more secure the network the more money it should attract is one theory. Also the higher the price goes up the more miners come into the space and the higher the hash goes up. So it's somewhere in between and it's a very fine balance. But what's really cool about this chart though is the hash rate has shot up nearly 40% since the bottom about 25 days ago and that is big a very big move. So it's getting harder once again for the miners to make money. Anyh who, moving on. We have another cool chart here which is not so cool and it reflects the overall sentiment and this is the risk appetite for Bitcoin index and basically it's hammering on the all-time low which we saw back in 2021 and 2022 etc. Nobody is going risk off into Bitcoin. Now despite it being so low, the price is still holding up there around that 67k level which is actually a positive sign. But again, nobody is thirsty for Bitcoin yet. Some smart people are doing their little DCA stuff, you know, guilty of that myself. Uh, I think it's a pretty good riskreward here. And considering the amount of money printing and debasement scarcity AI, you've heard this story before. It's got to it's got to return back up. But another weird chart which is also from Duran BTC and shout out to um Bitcoin long for this by the way brought it to my attention. Uh this is the worst performing having cycle in Bitcoin history by a factor of 100x. The 2016 cycle at this point was up 3,000%. The 2020 cycle at this point was well over 350 360%. this current cycle flat flat basically uh the having price was 64908 we're at 66920 so give or take 2 or 3% we're basically haven't moved since the having which is nearly 650 days ago it'll be 2 years in April so that's quite disappointing it was not the cycle that we expected nothing was same as before so moving on. Also, today we've been waiting for the so-called Clarity Act in the US to bring a lot of money into crypto. And the banks don't want to give up their gravy train, which I've covered many times before. They take your money, they pay you 0.01%. Like literally, no joke, you could drop a million dollars into a big top five American bank, and they'll pay you 0.1% on your million bucks. 10 million, 0.1%, 100 million, 0.1%. And then they lend it up in a fractional way. and they make 6% on that or 8% or if it's a credit card maybe even more. They don't want to give that up and that's where they're afraid of these stable coin things and the you know if they do why how else will they make profit? So there was a separate meeting. They're trying to get this thing pushed through. The banks have lobbied hard against it over competitive fears because if you can get yield on your stable coin, everybody will drop their cash into stable coins on chain and take them out of their banks from the banksters and then the banks won't be able to make their gravy train. It's very simple. This is what they're fighting against. Will they win? We shall see. They're looking at doing other things with incentives or trading fees or I don't know. Anyway, it's terrible. I think either way when when you try to prevent progress, you'll eventually shrivel up and die. So why prolong the inevitable as they say? Also another cool chart with lots of charts today on Bitcoin. Did promise you that. This is a one-mon TA which is pretty cool. This is from um I think it's psycho psycho something. really cool little chart and I grabbed it because it makes a lot of sense. Let me try to walk you through what it means. The chart is on the one monthly uh and you see a huge secular uptrend every single cycle. You got a breakout and then a retest of the prior all-time high. The prior all-time high bit for Bitcoin was 67K in April 2022 and then 69K in in November 2022. Then the bare market kicked in. But between let's say 67K which is exactly where we are now which is exactly where we were in April got that green box. Okay. So that's the first thing. The tags are the one month 50 EMA also the old all-time high. And historically this is an important piece. We never close on the monthly. We can peak beneath it with a candle but on the monthly we never close below the old all-time high. And the RSI resets to similar levels. And the cycle difference is the RSI has never ever entered over expansion. Right now RSI is at the bottom just like mean reversion is at the bottom since November 22 and 22. And will that level hold up? So this is you know I'm so weary if if we do break through that say close the monthly below say 614 that would be the first ever time in history that this has happened. We don't know if it's going to repeat and I don't want to jinx myself by saying it's a sure thing but it would be unusual if it does that means pretty much everything is broken now in other news too Salana TVL's keep on rising despite the crappy Salana price action total value locked on chain it keeps on going up Jupiter nearly 2.1 billion Camino 2 billion Sanctum 1.2 billion 1.1 billion Jetto 1.047 047 billion. By the way, there was a time where Jetto was number one. Now Jupiter is number one. And I still have a Jupiter position waiting for that thing to come back to life as well. Now, it was also another bad week, not just for the for the all the ETFs except for one, by the way. We'll get to that. But the Bitcoin ETFs, again, still down for the week. 400 million out of Bitcoin. About 350 million out the week before, about 320 million out the week before that. And before that it was billions and billions. Five weeks drainage. This is what Andrea is talking about. If the money comes back into the space, we could go very high very fast. But we need the money to come back. ETH has been following the Bitcoin ETF lows as well almost perfectly to a tea. The ETH ETF so far this week has drained $123.38 million. The week before was higher and the week before that was higher again. The week before that was higher again. The week before that was about uh I don't know a lot uh a lot indeed. So it has been a very ugly 5 weeks for ETH too. Let's check in on Salana see how they're doing. Well positive this week 11 million the week before about 134 million and they had two red weeks before that but since then overall it's been pretty much up which is breaking the trend with Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, somebody is trickling their money into Salana. Somebody sees something from a fundamental perspective. Let's talk about markets real quick. It has been a quiet market despite the crazy macro stuff which we'll get into in a second. Some very important micro stuff. But Google up 2%, Microsoft down 2%, Nvidia up 1%, Apple half a percent, Amazon up 5%, but remember Amazon was clobbered last week, Tesla down 1%. The rest kind of pretty humbho. Pounder recovered, Broadcom recovered. It's just but nothing nothing nothing too big to write home about. Also, we saw a new record too. Amazon became the largest seller, the largest revenue generator, the largest company on the earth with the largest number of sales. And that was always held by Walmart for the last 13 years straight. Guess what? The 31-year-old Amazon just knocked Walmart off the throne and they started as a bookstore and I believe soon it'll get to a trillion dollars. The currently their sales are about billion. So not far to go. They're growing at a 20% clip. They should be there in 2028 trillion dollar in sales of which they make good margin onto. Interesting to watch. That's probably why they can afford to invest so much in capex as well. Also, for those who are looking for a new utility truck, best car I've ever driven, I have one. Cybertruck has a flash sale for 10 days according to Elon Musk. You can buy now one [laughter] for $599.90. These were over 100 grand not too long ago. So, uh, again, it's America's bestselling electric truck, and all the other electric truck companies have departed the market, except for Rivian, but, uh, it's a lot better than Riv. It's bulletproof, four-wheel steering, all that good stuff. Fast as hell, too. Way quicker than Riven. So, if you need if you are somebody like me who has to do a lot of lugging stuff around, and, you know, it's worth going for a test drive. You will not look back. AI. Let's get into AI, which dovetales into crypto as well. Phantom came out with their multi- aent, multi-chain capability with their Phantom MCP server. So, agents can swap, sign, and manage addresses across all of Phantom supported chains. So, basically, it's multi-chain, multicurrency, multi- aent. It's all happening. And remember, remember this is the most important thing. Crypto is the only platform that can support this egentification of the planet that's happening. And this will blow your mind and you're not even going to believe this news when I say it, but it's true. [laughter] And it's also a little bit of silver lining, too, cuz people are saying, "Well, AI is going to take up over all the jobs." Well, no. No. AI is actually creating jobs. There's a new website called rent a human.ai, AI. And this is where agents go to rent humans and you can charge one guy here, I think Patricia Tanny, she charges $420 for her services. And what do they do? Well, what what the hell do AI agents need humans for? Well, there are some things that software or an agent out in the wherever they are can't do. for example, um be a power of attorney or sign documents or get notaries or verify locations or take pictures or so need some type of warm body. I don't know, warm warm body presence in a meeting. It's crazy. Maybe some field work. I don't know. But the machines are taking over and they're giving back. They're hiring humans. It's a crazy world. Absolutely crazy. Speaking of AI too, uh Google Gemini has just legged anthropic claude opus 4.6 which was a smoking hot LLM. By the way, this does not include XAI's Grock for some reason in their evaluations. They don't want to embarrass themselves, so they don't include it. But the data that I've looked at shows Grock is cheaper and faster, etc., etc., more capable, more honest as well. But here, Gemini 3.1 Pro preview leaprogs everything with a score of 57, which is quite a bit above 53. And of course, GPT is way in the distance. So, that was a big big jump as well. And other crazy news as well regarding AI. And remember, you have to lean into AI. It's big. It's an asteroid that's going to hit this planet. But here, this this took me by surprise. Shout out to Sunj2. This is what I call the fear versus excitement for planet Earth. Asia is absolutely off the charts in terms of AI enthusiasm. The bottom axis there is how excited people are. Goes up to 80%. China is the most excited. Also, China is the least fearful. The vertical axis on the left is how nervous people are about AI, how afraid they are. Japan, it seems like they're not excited and they're not afraid. They just don't give a damn. It's like it's not impacting their culture. And there are many people, you know, I speak to people all over the world and sometimes people in Europe and Scandinavia and stuff and I ask them, "Do you care about AI?" They say, "No, no, it's it's nothing. It's not impacting your life." So, for some reason, there are parts of the world that believe AI is a nothing burger or they haven't actually taken time to understand what it does. Place like Poland, Japan, Italy, Argentina, etc., Switzerland. Or maybe [sighs] they're not excited, but they're also not that afraid. Now, if you go to the United States, they have extreme anxiety. So does Ireland, Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, they're all very worried about AI. I'm not sure why, but they're not excited about it. So, what I conclude from this is Asia is very excited about it because they see the potential for it. And sometimes when humans see things that are new and different, they are afraid, nervous, and they back off because it's fear of the unknown. That's not a good way to be in this time. You got to lean into AI hard. And that's why the Chinese probably are so good at it because they're both excited by it and [clears throat] not afraid of it. So that's what you need to do when things get disrupted. Do not stick your head in the sand, my friends. Let's get into macro. This is going to be a little bit of a wild macro Friday. We'll go through it in four minutes or less. First of all, the PCE is up. This is the Fed's preferred indicator to see what's going on in the economy and inflation. Okay, their preferred gauge head P head headline PC rose to 2.9% year-over-year and that was above expectations at 2.8. Not a big burger, but they thought, you know, the peak was kind of way back when late 2024 and then all of a sudden it goes back to 3%. That has them a little bit nervous. Again, a core PC, as a reminder, excludes food and energy and it shouldn't be this high. Not at all. Now, this could be for a number of reasons. The government doesn't know how to measure stuff or they're very late, etc. Who knows? But I know things like uh what is [gasps] in there? uh rent is affect affecting this too because very few people can afford to buy a home and that's actually driving up the prices of rent which is a big impact on this too probably other factors too I know food shout out to our friends in Canada I read somewhere the price of food in Canada went up 7% in January alone that is pretty extreme anyhow who knows how they measure this stuff either way it's laggy and probably wrong because trueflation says something different then this is the bad news too the US is expecting the government grow by a lot. This is the GDP growth and last time they measured it the month before was 4.4%. And the expectation was 3% and it came in at 1.4%. So somebody's going to get spanked because that's not good. That's not good at all. And the economy is slowing. Now there is good news about this. First of all, when this news gets released, the markets get rattled and get really afraid and futures drop and prices drop. And then they think, "Oh, hey, guess what? If inflation is going up, that's bad. But if the economy is slowing, that's good for maybe a rate cut." So now people begin to think, okay, maybe the rates will go down and that'll help the economy. Who knows? It's all it's all nonsense. Anyway, and then we had this whole thing today as well. After them spending months and months and months trying to determine what to do with the tariffs, you won't believe this story. It's kind of mad. The US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariff authority 6 to3. That was big. How can it be so large and it take so many months to decide when the difference is so large, 6 to3? And then they believe when this first came out, they believe the US would have to refund 150 billion. But then [clears throat] it's all theater, ladies and gentlemen. And then Scott Passen comes out and he says, "Nope, don't worry. We're not going back. There will be no changes. There will be no changes in 2026." Absolutely crazy. Because the six judges simply ruled that the EA, I think it's called, cannot be used to raise even a dollar of revenue. But don't worry, the Treasury has a whole bunch of other plans to do that. They can raise tariff revenue using different tools. Here is a couple that I showcas. You got section 232, section 2011, 301, 122, 338. They have many ways in which they can not do tariffs. So all of this drama across PCE inflation and GDP growth and striking down the tariffs and then bringing in new tariffs, it's nonsense. Just stay the course. Don't be rattled by this short-term hour to hour news cycle because it'll rattle you out of position. And finishing up, Ila Musk is being sued for freedom of speech in Europe. Nothing else. Our European friends, we know everybody here from Europe is pro- freedom of speech. We love it. But the powers that be do not like it. And I love this little meme. And by the way, he's trying to sue them back. Give me your name and address if you want to speak freely. That is not freedom of speech, my friends. So anyway, make sure if you are in a nation, you have the ability to speak freely. It's the most important thing. It's the pillar of democracy, my friends. Hope you all learned something new today. And by the way, I'm going to check that little poll. Thank you to the team who ran it. Uh the preference on duration of videos, 39% 20 minutes, 31% 30 minutes. So somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes is optimal. 20% want 40 minutes plus. The Q&amp;A on the weekends is always very deep and long, so that tends to be 40 42 minutes. Uh, but this is really good to know. I thought people were getting a shorter attention span. Only 10% wanted a 10-minute video. Good. 10-minute videos would be easy to do. I come up here, talk freely for 10 minutes on anything, any time, but doesn't require 10 hours of preparation. But I'm glad people want more information. And that's what we do here. KPM, knowledge per minute, every single piece of information I put out there. You learn something new every 60 seconds. That's always been my goal from the beginning because that's the way I like to learn too. [clears throat] Grateful to everybody here. Thank you to the mods in the chat and the whole team that's out there. And a shout out to Jean D&amp;D K8 Hala Swiping and Swiping Piper and DBF430. Appreciate you from all over the world. God, Canada, Hawaii, Swiper, I don't know where you're based, and DBF in Australia. All over the world. Love it. Thank you. Have a great great Friday night. See you all tomorrow. Bye.
